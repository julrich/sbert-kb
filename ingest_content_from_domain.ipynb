You may pick up some issues here and there during dev but at the end you will have to go through the browsing testing round either way to make sure all works correctly… Javier PS: You should change the rollover color of the links for your comments, it goes to black text with black background 🙂 Daniel Awesome idea!!\n"

By taking care of the boring stuff, users of the design system don’t have to think about (or at least think as hard about) certain things, freeing them up to focus on more pressing tasks. One little trick that I picked up from browsing the Lightning Design System React library was automatically generating ids using a little library called shortid, which generates a unique gobbledygook string like qPbdivDEiH. We can still give developers to define their own id and aria-describedby attributes, but if they fail to enter them those ids are automatically generated.\n"

For instance, authoring  results in a button that has secondary styling (which may involve a different background color) but is also larger than the default button styles. So the system designers lay out very clear documentation on how these components should (and shouldn’t) be used: At the end of the day, take the time to craft a set of robust, flexible, and extensible components for your design system.\n"

I thought I’d be sick of talking about this by now, but I’m still passionate about atomic design after hearing so many success stories, as well as witnessing firsthand what happens when teams build design systems in isolation (spoiler: it doesn’t work out too well). This post explains the concept of design tokens well: design tokens are an agnostic way to store variables such as typography, color, and spacing so that your design system can be shared across platforms like iOS, Android, and regular ol’ websites So how does this fit into atomic design?\n",

If the team comes to the design system and doesn’t find the component they need, if an existing component doesn’t fulfill all the requirements, or if they’re just not sure if the system has what they need, the first step is for the product team to reach out to the design system team via Slack, issue trackers (Github, Jira, etc), or other channel (Note: the design system team should establish clear support protocol).\n",

When these resources set up outside the workflow of designers and developers, they don’t get used, they get stale, they become irrelevant. Following the workshop/storefront model—and stitching the two together so that one feeds the other—has ensured that the design systems we create continue to be used, vital, dynamic.\n"

Setting up the style guide early helps the team have conversations about how best to integrate the system and guide into the teams workflow, and how best to keep the style guide’s components, documentation, and guidelines up to date with as little friction as possible. After a lot of hard work and iteration, you’ll finally reach a point where the design system’s ingredients and the accompanying style guide are ready for prime time.\n",

      "https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/ The style guide is the storefront I tend to define a design system as all the things that go into doing design at an organization. That means the design system can include things like principles, high-level guidelines (UX conventions, UI code conventions, etc), UI components, documentation, tools, resources, and more. I tend to define a style guide as the happy home where all that design system stuff lives.  A style guide is the storefront where all the ingredients of the design system are put out on the shelves. The style guide storefront is designed for a different context than the design/dev environment workshop. Rather than being a tool for only the design systems team to make use of, the style guide communicates the design system to the whole organization. That means the style guide audience should be cross-disciplinary, since a design system can help create a shared vocabulary between all the people who are responsible for the success of the products at the organization. The style guide should provide information helpful for both makers and users of the design system, and should be used as a vehicle to continuously sell the value of the design system to the organization. With those considerations in mind, let’s look at how we presented our data tables in the style guide. The display of the components within the style guide serves a different purpose than the display of the components within the dev environment. Rather than purely displaying the “what”, the style guide provides an opportunity to explain the “why”, “how”, “where”, and “who” as well.\n",

This opens the door to more typos and having to touch multiple things if you want to rename a component. More verbose– This approach is not as succinct as nesting child and modifier selectors, meaning developers have to write more characters to accomplish their styling.\n",

      "https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/ What do consumable UI components look like? So what does this look like? Consider an alert component: The basic gist of the markup for the component (written in JSX) would look something like this: c-alert ${variant}} role='alert' {...other} >   {title}  {children}    We’re carving out slots for the dynamic bits (such as title) that will be populated by the application developer. Once the component is built, others need to be able to use it. One way is to have a “ui-components” folder within the application, but better yet is to publish it as its own product (Look ma! I’m publishing my own UI framework!). If you go that route, back-of-the-frontend developers can suck in your component library like so: npm install our-react-design-system Once the component library is installed, devs can plug in that alert component: import Alert from \"our-react-design-system/components/Alert\";  You have successfully updated your profile.  Where’s that copy coming from? What’s triggering the alert? That’s the realm of back-of-the-frontend developers. They take these presentational UI components and wrap them in a layer of smarts that handles business logic, data manipulation, and whatever else they need to successfully implement the alert component in the real application.\n",

      "https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system/ Your Sketch library is not a design system You can write words explaining how to properly use a toaster, draw pictures of toasters, and even create more efficient ways to draw pictures of toasters. But at the end of the day, if you don’t have a functioning toaster, all that effort is for naught. In my design system workshops at design conferences, I’ll ask attendees where they are in their design system journey. Most hands go up when I ask them if their organization has a design system in place. However, when I ask to see them, a lot of attendees will show me a Sketch library or a style guide website with plenty of screenshots and prose, but lacking in living, breathing UI components. This may sound obvious, but it’s important to understand that you can’t build working software out of screenshots and Sketch files. It’s not that static design tools and documentation aren’t important (they are!), but they can’t create functioning UI components that can be used to build real software applications. Static design files, pattern documentation, guidelines, and the rest of the all help tell the story of how your organization designs and builds products, but recognize that  at  the heart of any great design system is a reusable set of UI components that product teams can reach for to build actual software. So what’s a team to do to make sure you’re prioritizing building real functioning UI components? - Make sure you have frontend designers on your design system team. If you don’t have any or enough, hire some. There are tons of frontend designers out there hankering to build clean, beautiful modular, reusable frontend code. - Establish a pattern-driven, cross-disciplinary workflow that emphasizes getting into the browser early and iteration over frontend code. Rather than designers only staying within the comfortable walls of their static design tools, encourage pairing with developers to ensure the design vision makes its way into the actual code that will be deployed to real products. - Early on in your design system initiative, discuss the methods you’ll use to deploy your UI components into product codebases, then quickly trial that workflow using a single component (“OK, here’s our design system’s button component, how do we get this to show up on our homepage?”) - Understand the friction between creating functioning UI components that use specific technologies (such as React, Angular, Twig, et al) and create a design system that’s bigger than any one technology implementation. - Make sure that the living, breathing patterns and code are displayed alongside any design documentation and screenshots in your style guide storefront. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s fantastic that tools like Sketch, InVision Studio, Adobe XD, Figma, and others are finally recognizing the importance of creating reusable UI components, and sharing those between team members. I’m even more excited about the many efforts to backfill living components into static design tools so designers can create screens that accurately represent how those screens will look in the browser. There is real value in using static design tools to work with a design system, but be sure to keep your eye on the prize: creating a beautiful, flexible, reusable collection of frontend components that can be used to build real software. Now get out there and build some toasters. Update: if you’re hot and bothered over this post, you can read my follow up post here.\n",

      "https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/ A place for frontend designers in this brave new javascript world As the pattern library craze was ramping up, Dave Rupert struck a nerve when he said we need to deliver “tiny Bootstraps, for every client”. Responsive deliverables should look a lot like fully-functioning Twitter Bootstrap-style systems custom tailored for your clients’ needs. He hit the nail on the head, especially the “custom-tailored for your clients’ needs” part. That’s what we’ve seen come to fruition with the explosion of design systems: all these pattern libraries containing solutions to each organization’s thorny UI problems. Coming back to Bootstrap, the problem in the olden days was that developers could wire up Bootstrap’s CSS and JS files, but had to manually translate Bootstrap’s HTML into their own environments. In this brave new world, things work differently. We now have directly consumable components, meaning that a component’s structure, style, and behavior can all travel together as a neat, tidy bundle. This changes things in tremendously exciting ways. In the React world, there are frameworks like Material UI and React Bootstrap that translate these popular frontend UI libraries into directly consumable React components. These prefab solutions have their place, but many organizations like are crafting their own custom UI component libraries to serve their needs. Check out Salesforce’s Lightning Design System for React, The React flavor of IBM’s Carbon Design System, Shopify’s Polaris, and many more examples. So with directly consumable UI components in mind, here’s my updated take on Dave’s words of wisdom: Frontend design deliverables should look a lot like fully-functioning React Bootstrap-style systems custom tailored for your clients’ needs. It’s a subtle but important difference. Instead of merely creating components’ reference HTML, CSS, and presentational JS, frontend designers can create directly consumable HTML, CSS, and presentational JS that back-of-the-frontend developers can then breathe life into. But note that “custom tailored for your clients’ needs” is still intact. I’m not saying “Just use React Bootstrap,” but rather create a library of UI components that serves your specific needs. As I see it, directly consumable UI components serve as a bridge between The Great Divide. It creates a healthy handshake between the front of the frontend and the back of the frontend. So in order to make this happen, I had to add the following responsibilities to the list I laid out at the beginning of this post: Create a library of presentational UI componentsthat are packaged up to be consumed by other developers. Author and document a robust, intuitive component API for each presentational componentso developers consuming the component can easily plug whatever they need into to it Determine how flexible or rigid the component library should be, working with developers to understand how open/composable or rigid/locked down each component should be. Maintain the presentational components as a product,meaning I have to handle versioning, deploying, governance, release notes and all the operational stuff goes into maintaining a software product. And most importantly, I had to roll my sleeves up and learn JS frameworks like React. Not all of React and Friends, mind you, but the parts of React that are needed to do good frontend design work.\n",

      "\t9.700\thttps://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/: My prior definition of design systems was this: A design system is the official story of how an organization designs and builds digital products. But my updated definition is as follows: A design system is the official story of how an organization designs and builds digital interfaces. Changing “products” to “interfaces” is a small-but-important change. As mentioned above, there are many different facets to creating digital products, and a design system by itself shouldn’t define and own every standard for creating successful digital products. By creating a boundary around shared UI patterns, we’ve found clarity in our design system work. Like most things in this ever-changing field, we’re constantly refining and honing our mental models and language in order to do better work.\n",
      "\t9.147\thttps://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/: Nathan Curtis said it well: design systems are systems of systems. A design system often contains many subsystems that make an interface tick: - UI components and variants in design and code - Design tokens - Typography system - Color system - Layout/Grid system - Icon system These subsystems all come together to help build high-quality user interfaces out of a well-considered set of reusable components.\n",
      "\t8.720\thttps://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/: We often talk about design systems as singular entities. “The design system saves time and increases quality.” “Oh, the design system provides that.” “Update to the latest version of the design system.” The reality is that a design system is a multi-faceted layer cake, and also operates as part of other layered systems within an organization. Design systems are systems of systems, but not all systems are part of the design system. Confused? You’re certainly not alone. This post tries to articulate how my own definition of a design system has recently changed to address some hard-earned lessons.\n",
      "\t8.474\thttps://bradfrost.com/blog/link/design-systems/: Here’s Jeremy with some wise words about design systems. The generally-accepted definition of a design system is that it’s the outer circle—it encompasses pattern libraries, style guides, and any other artefacts. But there’s something more. Just because you have a collection of design patterns doesn’t mean you have a design system. A system is a framework. It’s a rulebook. It’s what tells you howthose patterns work together. I agree. I tend to define a design system as the official story of how your organization designs and builds digital products. There are a lot of ingredients involved in telling that story. A kit of UI components without accompanying philosophy, principles, guidelines, processes, and documentation is like dumping a bunch of IKEA components on the floor and saying “Here, build a dresser!” The guidelines and documentation accompanying the UI components serve as the instruction manual that come with the IKEA components to help the user properly and successfully build furniture.\n",
