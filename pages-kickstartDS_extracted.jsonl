We'll live off of everything already set in place by our existing\nDesign Token and component structure.\nOverview\nMore concretely: what we're building up to in this example... and for the sake of imagination, assume this was what your designer cooked up:\nThis will be done in three simple steps:\n- Component Definition,\n- Component Mapping, and\n- Component Creation\nFor more details about those steps, have a look at the guide about different component processes and their shared structure.\nRequirements\nThis guide assumes that you already have a working Design System, that is based on\nkickstartDS, running.\nIf that's not the case, follow our Create your Design System guide .\nAdditionally you'll need access to our\nContent module, to use the\nStorytelling component this guide is based on.\nkickstartDS Content Module\nThe perfect addition to our Open Source base\nThe\nContent Module includes seven rich components: Hero visual, Quote, Storytelling etc. ‚Äî everything you need to build beautiful content experiences or to enrich your existing Design System\n1. Component Definition\nPurpose\nWe want to create an element that can be interjected into otherwise monotone content. To direct focus, or present alternatives, to the main body of content.\nWe'll probably need to be able to define a\ntitle and some\nbody content. Additionally, we want to add some flavour to the component by using noticeable design variations, not typically found in our other components.\nAdding a static background image to the component could be nice touch!\nFinally being able to add a\nlink with a link target (\nlink.target) and and link text (\nlink.text) will be needed, but they should be optional.\nStructure\nThis would leave us with the following properties (API) for our new component. Required fields are marked with a\n:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Title to show|\n|Body content to display|\n|Page to link to|\n|Text to use for the link|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n.\nWhile directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our\nJSON Schema later!\n2. Component Mapping\nNext we want to search for components that could be of use in assembling this new one. This might be a single, big component that more or less directly fits our use case, or alternatively a combination of components that could serve as the basis by combining them.\nThis will then serve as our\nkickstartDS base component, which will be adjusted to fit our needs!\nMatching it\nFrom a quick glance, our\nStorytelling component seems like it might fit the bill quite nicely! It has options for a\ntitle (\nbox.headline) and\nbody (\nbox.text), supports some RTE-like formatting for our\nbody, and has a wide range of possible design adjustments: mainly background colors & images, an optional foreground image and a bunch of possible arrangements of those.\nThis would also enable us to add a nice-looking background image to the whole component by using a combination of its attributes\nbackgroundImage and\nbackgroundColor:\nFor a complete overview of the available options, take a look at the\nStorytelling component API here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/content-storytelling--image\nAdjustments\nThis only gives us a rough sketch, though. We still need to adjust the example code to exactly fit our needs. In the process we will hard-code a bunch of options, because we're only interested in a specific set of them. The rest can be set to default values, which don't need to become part of the component API.\nGreat components\nSed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.\nStart with an existing\nStorytelling component variant\nWe'll start by copying the\nJSX code for the\nImage variant of our\nStorytelling component, from here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/content-storytelling--image\nRemove all of the unneeded stuff\nThere are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values\nundefined or\nnull in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nWe'll also not be utilizing the\nimage, at least for now!\nHard-code static, required properties\nWe add nice values for\nbackgroundColor and\nbackgroundImage, invert everything with\nks-inverted to make it pop, and change some alignments for the\nbox, as well as make the\nheadline \"louder\" by styling it as a\nh1.\nAdd some demo content\nNow we just need to enter some \"real\" content, and we've successfully recreated what we set out to do in the start.

Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/interstitial, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/interstitial\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nTo learn more about our use of\nJSON Schema, read our Foundations page about it.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute. The correct\n$id depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix\nhttp://schema.mydesignsystem.com.\nCreate\ntitle and\nbody fields...\nBoth fields are straight-forward\nstring type properties, so we just document them a bit!\nWe do mark them by setting\nformat to\nmarkdown, though, which enables light RTE functionality in its rendering later on.\n... and make them required\nWe declare both properties as required!\nAdd object to hold\nlink properties\nThis will hold our properties\ntarget and\ntext. We add them to their own object to indicate that they're used to be together, thus hinting at their combined usage.\nAdd\ntarget and\ntext to\nlink property\nFinalizing our\nJSON Schema, we add the two last\nlink sub properties\ntarget and\nlink, both again simple\nstring types.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nLet's have a look at our completed\nJSON Schema definition.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nTo learn more about our use of\nJSON Schema, read our Foundations page about it.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\nReact Template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\nkickstartDS\nStorytelling component.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component. We're using TypeScript here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\nJSX (\n.jsx).\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nInterstitialProps.ts. Generated by our\nJSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nDestructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We'll just pass through everything\nHTMLDivElement related!\nWhile at it, some dummy markup for our properties is added.\nAdd\nStorytelling component\nNow we'll import the\nkickstartDS\nStorytelling component.

In almost every channel from the Design System space, you can feel a crispy white noise around the broad topic of Design Token. We also put in a lot of effort when refactoring our Token structure in kickstartDS for our latest release. It might look over-engineered on a first glimpse, but we understand ourselves as a meta framework for Design System creation and therefore want to provide you best practice defaults.\nBranding, Design & Component Token\nToken are the smallest building blocks of a Design System. Based on the values they store, they are usually used across multiple tools and platforms to ensure consistency and matching brand identity. kickstartDS differentiates between\nBranding, Design and Component Token. Whereas Design Token store values e.g. color, typography, spacing, animation, etc., Branding Token come in handy offering a structured approach towards applying your company‚Äôs brand identity or corporate design at one single spot with maximum efficiency. Component Token represent the properties and values that are contained in a component, e.g. controlling how its container, label text, icons, and states look. Since we are publicly open source now, the great thing is, that you can check out that structure on your own in our repo.\nWe fully rely on\nsemantic token within kickstartDS\nWith this release we implemented semantic token, which is a rather modern concept that mainly involves naming tokens by their intended use. Some teams refer to these with names like alias tokens or purpose tokens, all describing basically the same concept of including intention in the token name, in comparison to just naming it by its current value (like ‚Äúcolor-red‚Äù).\nExample: \n$background-color-success\nvs\n$background-color-green\nI don‚Äôt want to go into more detail in this post, as these concepts are already very much explored by well known people from the community üòâ\nFor example Nathan Curtis article:\nhttps://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/naming-tokens-in-design-systems-9e86c7444676\nOther valuable reads are from Lukas Oppermann and Dannie Damato\nhttps://uxdesign.cc/naming-design-tokens-9454818ed7cb https://blog.damato.design/posts/tokens-as-intents/\nBase scales vs Semantic Token\nAs described in the paragraph above semantic token are the concept we apply when building components, whereas base scales are another concept we use as the input for your semantic token. You choose your semantic token from a set of base values and scales, think of those as the painters palette, making sure there‚Äôs a lot of re-use (aliasing) in your Design Token. In turn enabling efficient, consistent changes to your semantic token. There are scales for different kinds of token, such as color or spacing for example. A base scale for these token is generated by default. You can edit the scales when applying to fully match your brand‚Äôs identity.\nStructured token following Style Dictionary format\nTaking the code perspective: token in kickstartDS are structured using JSON, following the Style Dictionary format. Style Dictionary is an Open Source tool developed by Amazon that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume.\nWith Style Dictionary you can manage Design Token and organize them into collections of JSON files. In addition, you can export those organized tokens to many platforms, tools or integrations by using its so-called transform groups to generate technology-specific formats or deliverables.\nSide note: we are eagerly awaiting the release of the W3C Design Token Group format, with the intention with following it whenever it is finally decided.\nUsing such an established approach with Style Dictionary in the meantime allows to benefit from its general community adoption, a lot of extensions, plugins and automation already being written for you.\nThemes for Bootstrap, MaterialUI, TailwindCSS, Fiori and others\nFacilitating Style Dictionary, we can use its transform groups to derive and generate themes for 3\nrd party component libraries such as Bootstrap, MUI or even SAP Fiori. We are working on ready-to-use examples to help you distribute your Design Token and assets into these environments. We‚Äôve started with early tests on this, but the goal is to provide ready-made configurations. Giving you a great starting point by having best practice connections between themed solutions like MUI and your Design Token.\nStyle native mobile Apps through token\nAs you might have noticed already most of that transformation-stuff is made possible by Style Dictionary. Hence, similar configurations can be set up to apply token for their usage in native apps in Android or iOS.\nCSS Custom Property transform group\nCustom properties are the bedrock of our component implementation when it comes to encoding design and layout. We transform your Style Dictionary into a set of those CSS Custom Properties, which are then layered onto components in the form of Component Token. So a ‚ÄúButton‚Äù may use one semantic color token for its label text by default (‚Äú‚Äìks-text-color-interface-interactive‚Äù), but in a different variant an ‚ÄúAlertButton‚Äù might be specifically layered with a semantic color token signifying a problem (one based on ‚Äú‚Äìks-color-negative‚Äù), while still re-using the rest of the default ‚ÄúButton‚Äù token mapping.\nSynchronization of Design Token from Figma\nSince Figma still does not offer a full, native integration or treatment of Design Token, we are working on a synchronization from Figma to JSON. You might be familiar with the Figma Token plugin or tools like Specify for this dynamic exchange between design and code. We are currently working on a solution, as a perfect addition and fit for the Token structure in kickstartDS, to also make this part of the design process efficient and easy like squeezing a lemon. Unlike hassling around with configurations to be adjusted, or concepts not quite fitting your intention, this will be opinionated and tailor-made to the way we‚Äôve approached token in kickstartDS.\nMultibrand-theming and layering with kickstartDS\nYou can declare Design Token for each of your brands/themes within a layered instance of kickstartDS. You or your DesignOps team can specify which component for which brand should be based on the core components, or instead be fully customized for that specific use case‚Ä¶ keeping it from polluting the (shared) core.\nAnd if it‚Äôs just another layer of paint for one of your sub-brands, you can even get away with just defining an additional token set.

By default our components come with a huge set of properties.

You can also create wholly new components based only on following kickstartDS‚Äô systematic approach, without actually using base components.\nUltimately, adapt and make the default process yours\nWe propagate code first, when talking about the source of truth of Design Systems. Users interact with coded components, not with the (Figma, Adobe XD or Sketch) design files which are often the starting point for exploration of the component use cases or even full-page layouts to be adopted by the developers.\nDepending on which handover process you have implemented and how deeply designers interact with developers, handling Design Token through Style Dictionary generates high value for both parties. It gives designers the power to keep owning their design decisions, as developers usually, for example, do not like to decide which color to use (one more reason to rely on semantic tokens).

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro", "content": {"raw": "Introduction to kickstartDS\nkickstartDS is an Open Source Design System starter and UI toolkit for building up your very own Design System. This in turn enables you, and your team, to build brand-compliant websites and apps super efficiently. All while using core web technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî and best practices.\nCheck out the following video for a more in-depth demonstration, and see kickstartDS in action (timestamped start):\nMany thanks to Amplifyn for allowing us to use their recording.\nGet started\nGet started building your own Design System by installing\nkickstartDS into your project, or by following our Create your first Design Systemguide, to learn about the main concepts involved.\nOverview\nkickstartDS focuses on the consistent frontend UX and UI interaction of components ‚Äî colors, layout, interactions, animations. It's easy to adapt, and integrates with every frontend-approach that works with regular HTML.\nAdditionally, under the hood,\nReact is used as the templating layer of choice, but integration into your templating layer, or backend, of choice is in no way limited by this, as everything is written to be usable without a React runtime! Only development of new components involves, and benefits by, the use of React!\nFramework-agnostic\nEvery kickstartDS component consists of semantic HTML(5), CSS Modules & Properties and JavaScript (ES6). This makes it easy to implement across any framework or even stand alone.\nAlternatively, use our ready-to-use\nReact components directly in your codebase!\nQuality UX\nA quality UX is defined not only by relevant content and services, it is also a matter of a clear and consistent brand image, with intuitive and usable interaction patterns and features.\nUse our experience to your advantage!\nPerformance\nBuilt for maximum performance. The kickstartDS components runtime, design token system and CSS framework are as lightweight as you need it to be.\nStop thinking about build tooling and bundling!\nAccessibility\nkickstartDS provides support for W3C‚Äôs WCAG 2.1 spec. We take care that components support touch and keyboard navigation, screen readers and more.\nAnd if needed, we can give you pointers for your content!\nGoals\nGreat components as the baseline\nMake the most out of your frontend interfaces by unifying their core ‚Äì utilizing component and design Token, component APIs and props and a shared core as a baseline to unlock effiency when implementing new applications of your Design System.\nkickstartDS aims to be the foundation for your Design System, built with reusable components and tools itself, guided by clear standards, that can be adopted and assembled together, to create your products: fast, flexible, responsive, accessible and best of all: you can plug it onto every digital touch point you own!\nEnable flexible + easy design application\nEstablish one common ground for developers and designers to deliver on your marketing, branding and design requirements.\nkickstartDS should help developers and designers in independently delivering a consistent UX and engaging user interfaces.\nWith\nkickstartDS teams should be able to design, build, and organize UI components better and faster. Using Storybook you make sure every element aligns with all the responsive scenarios your users may encounter, and components are developed independently!\nWork with \"classic\" backend environments\nProvide tooling to support your integration tasks, by improving developer DX drastically. Working with a more \"classic\" approach shouldn't mean you'd have to lack tooling to support your daily work.\nBecause not every potential touchpoint can be run headless, and integration of HTML markup into backend templates still plays a very important role today. Be it your Rails-driven eCommerce site, a blog you run for your marketing department, or a fully custom backend-rendering based approach.\nChangelogs with automatic markup change detection and documentation, copy-pasteable & configurable HTML-Snippets through Storybook, and optimized JavaScript and CSS bundles lighten your load!\nJamstack & composable integrations\nStarting with a strong common ground in your Design System you should be able to integrate fitting solutions as you go. This gets especially easy when opting for React as the central building block of your tech stack.\nWith\nkickstartDS components at their core already being pure, functional React components, composability should be encouraged on all levels. With a multitude of existing integrations, common tasks can be reduced to just adding the correct one to the mix!\nAdditionally an added, optional layer of React concepts should support those use cases:\n- React Provider / Context\n- React Render Props\nWorking on a marketing- or landing-page, or a blog? Get the page builder experience with Netlify CMS, Sanity, Tina CMS or Wordpress in combination with the official kickstartDS Gatsby theme.\nBuilding a Next.js page or application?

This in turn enables you, and your team, to build brand-compliant websites and apps super efficiently. All while using core web technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî and best practices.\nCheck out the following video for a more in-depth demonstration, and see kickstartDS in action (timestamped start):\nMany thanks to Amplifyn for allowing us to use their recording.\n## Get started\nGet started building your own Design System by installing\n**kickstartDS** into your project, or by following our Create your first Design Systemguide, to learn about the main concepts involved.\n## Overview\n**kickstartDS** focuses on the consistent frontend UX and UI interaction of components ‚Äî colors, layout, interactions, animations. It's easy to adapt, and integrates with every frontend-approach that works with regular HTML.\nAdditionally, under the hood,\n**React** is used as the templating layer of choice, but integration into your templating layer, or backend, of choice is in no way limited by this, as everything is written to be usable without a React runtime! Only development of new components involves, and benefits by, the use of React!\n### Framework-agnostic\nEvery kickstartDS component consists of semantic HTML(5), CSS Modules & Properties and JavaScript (ES6). This makes it easy to implement across any framework or even stand alone.\nAlternatively, use our ready-to-use\n**React** components directly in your codebase!\n### Quality UX\nA quality UX is defined not only by relevant content and services, it is also a matter of a clear and consistent brand image, with intuitive and usable interaction patterns and features.\nUse our experience to your advantage!\n### Performance\nBuilt for maximum performance. The kickstartDS components runtime, design token system and CSS framework are as lightweight as you need it to be.\nStop thinking about build tooling and bundling!\n### Accessibility\n**kickstartDS** provides support for W3C‚Äôs WCAG 2.1 spec. We take care that components support touch and keyboard navigation, screen readers and more.\nAnd if needed, we can give you pointers for your content!\n## Goals\n### Great components as the baseline\nMake the most out of your frontend interfaces by unifying their core ‚Äì utilizing component and design Token, component APIs and props and a shared core as a baseline to unlock effiency when implementing new applications of your Design System.\n**kickstartDS** aims to be the foundation for your Design System, built with reusable components and tools itself, guided by clear standards, that can be adopted and assembled together, to create your products: fast, flexible, responsive, accessible and best of all: you can plug it onto every digital touch point you own!\n### Enable flexible + easy design application\nEstablish one common ground for developers and designers to deliver on your marketing, branding and design requirements.\n**kickstartDS** should help developers and designers in independently delivering a consistent UX and engaging user interfaces.\nWith\n**kickstartDS** teams should be able to design, build, and organize UI components better and faster. Using Storybook you make sure every element aligns with all the responsive scenarios your users may encounter, and components are developed independently!\n### Work with \"classic\" backend environments\nProvide tooling to support your integration tasks, by improving developer DX drastically. Working with a more \"classic\" approach shouldn't mean you'd have to lack tooling to support your daily work.\nBecause not every potential touchpoint can be run headless, and integration of HTML markup into backend templates still plays a very important role today. Be it your Rails-driven eCommerce site, a blog you run for your marketing department, or a fully custom backend-rendering based approach.\nChangelogs with automatic markup change detection and documentation, copy-pasteable & configurable HTML-Snippets through Storybook, and optimized JavaScript and CSS bundles lighten your load!\n### Jamstack & composable integrations\nStarting with a strong common ground in your Design System you should be able to integrate fitting solutions as you go. This gets especially easy when opting for React as the central building block of your tech stack.\nWith\n**kickstartDS** components at their core already being pure, functional React components, composability should be encouraged on all levels. With a multitude of existing integrations, common tasks can be reduced to just adding the correct one to the mix!\nAdditionally an added, optional layer of React concepts should support those use cases:\n- React Provider / Context\n- React Render Props\nWorking on a marketing- or landing-page, or a blog?

But unlike just adapting a component, customizing a component also involves adding something to it, or changing the way certain things work under the hood, by modifying its React template (whereas extending a component does that by composing multiple kickstartDS base components). This expands possible applications of existing kickstartDS components greatly.\nEven while using the component rather directly from\nkickstartDS, you'll want to find the correct set of properties for your own use case. Components in kickstartDS come equipped with properties for a wide range of possible use cases, so it makes sense to reduce those to the ones you really need... to make components easier to understand, use and reason about!\nWe call this type of workflow\nCustomization. Learn more about it in our dedicated guide about it. If you're unsure about something, have a look over there. We go into more background detail there about what we're doing here.\nNot touching the actual markup generated by components let's us get by without adding any custom styling (\nCSS / SCSS) to it. We simply reuse the already existing Design Token and component structure.\nOverview\nThis is how the result of this guide will look like:\nIt will only need two simple steps for that:\n- Component Definition, and\n- Component Creation\nFor more details about those steps, have a look at the guide about different component processes and their shared structure.\nRequirements\nThis guide assumes that you already have a working Design System, that is based on\nkickstartDS, running.\nIf that's not the case, follow our Create your Design System guide.\n1. Component Definition\nPurpose\nWe like what the\nkickstartDS base\nHeadline component has to offer. We just feel that we need a bit more flexibility in arranging the headlines different contents, which we try to achieve by making the order of headline and subheadline switcheable. We also want some light RTE-like content formatting options for all rendered text, while keeping the component simple by just mapping properties really needed by our use case.\nWe take\nlevel and\nspaceAfter directly, and rename\nsubheadline to\nsub,\nstyleAs to\nstyle and\ncontent to\ntext for our version of the\nHeadline. And crucially we add our own property\nswitchOrder into the mix.\nWe also keep the name\nHeadline, as it fits our use case well enough already.\nStructure\nDefining the structure of a component means finding the component API for it:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text content of headline|\n|Subheadline content|\n|Switch order of headline and subheadline|\n|Level of headline to use|\n|Style of headline to show|\n|Whether to display space after headline|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\nWhile directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our\nJSON Schema later!\n2. Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/headline, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/headline\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute.

We also set a\ndefault.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nLet's have a look at our completed\nJSON Schema definition.\nThis concludes creating the\nJSON Schema. When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\nReact template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\nkickstartDS\nStorytelling component.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component. We're using TypeScript here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\nJSX (\n.jsx).\nDefining\nRenderFunctions\nWe define the render functions interface that will enable our RTE-like functionality for the\ntext and\nsub properties.\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nHeadlineProps.ts. Generated by our\nJSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add our rendering functions and\nHTMLAttributes to the type signature.\nDestructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We add our\ndefault values here, too. Because we're using rendering functions, we also need to have those in there... we'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\nAdd\nHeadline component 1/5\nAs we can't use the underlying\nkickstartDS base component\nexport directly, because we intend to customize its behaviour, we start with the raw component template of the original\nkickstartDS\nHeadline instead. You can find its markup in our Github mono-repository here.\nWe also write the\nlevel into\nTagName, which we'll use to generically render the correct markup tag for the\nHeadline.\nAdd\nHeadline component 2/5\nWe then remove options we don't intend to use...\nAdd\nHeadline component 3/5\n... and rename and rewire the properties to our component API.\nAdd\nHeadline component 4/5\nMost importantly, we now add our customized behaviour using\nswitchOrder.\nAdd\nHeadline component 5/5\nFinally we make sure not to render anything, if both\ntext and\nsub are empty.\nAdd component\nProvider\nWe want our\nHeadline to replace all default\nkickstartDS base\nHeadlines, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\nFinished\nReact template\nLet's have a look at our completed\nReact template.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component.

We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\nFinished\nReact template\nLet's have a look at our completed\nReact template.\nTo complete the template we add the\nHeadlineProvider to our\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx:\nThis concludes the creation of our new\nHeadline component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\nUse of\nStorybook\nIf you're using\nStorybook, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with kickstartDS!\nStorybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/headline folder:\nImport\nHeadline component\nImport\nHeadline component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\nStories to.\nImport\nStorybook Controls helpers\nImport dereferenced component\nJSON Schema and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\nStorybook Controls, and parameterize Storybook JSON Schema Addon.\nImport re-usable\nHeadline\nStories...\nWe import the existing\nHeadline\nStory part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\nStory defaults specific to our component.\nConvert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\nJSON args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\nStorybook Controls get generated off.\nCreate\nHeadline variants\nWe do this by binding to our\nTemplate, and use\npack to convert all deep\nJSON args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\nStorybook Controls get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\nStorybook now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nHeadline in all its glory!\nFinished\nCode Sandbox\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\nCode Sandbox:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1", "markdown": "# Customize\nHeadline component\nThis guided example shows how you'd add components to your Design System that use a\n**kickstartDS** base component pretty directly.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\n**React** template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\n**kickstartDS**\nStorytelling component.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component. We're using **TypeScript** here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\n**JSX** (\n.jsx).\n##### Defining\nRenderFunctions\nWe define the render functions interface that will enable our RTE-like functionality for the\ntext and\nsub properties.\n#### Add correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nHeadlineProps.ts. Generated by our\n**JSON Schema**, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with **TypeScript** this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add our rendering functions and\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> to the type signature.\n#### Destructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We add our\ndefault values here, too. Because we're using rendering functions, we also need to have those in there... we'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\n#### Add\nHeadline component 1/5\nAs we can't use the underlying\n**kickstartDS** base component\nexport directly, because we intend to customize its behaviour, we start with the raw component template of the original\n**kickstartDS**\nHeadline instead. You can find its markup in our Github mono-repository here.\nWe also write the\nlevel into\nTagName, which we'll use to generically render the correct markup tag for the\nHeadline.\n#### Add\nHeadline component 2/5\nWe then remove options we don't intend to use...\n#### Add\nHeadline component 3/5\n... and rename and rewire the properties to our component API.\n#### Add\nHeadline component 4/5\nMost importantly, we now add our customized behaviour using\nswitchOrder.\n#### Add\nHeadline component 5/5\nFinally we make sure not to render anything, if both\ntext and\nsub are empty.\n#### Add component\nProvider\nWe want our\nHeadline to replace all default\n**kickstartDS** base\nHeadlines, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**React** template.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component.

We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**React** template.\nTo complete the template we add the\nHeadlineProvider to our\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx:\nThis concludes the creation of our new\nHeadline component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\n## Use of\n**Storybook**\nIf you're using\n**Storybook**, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with **kickstartDS**!\n##### Storybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/headline folder:\n### Import\nHeadline component\nImport\nHeadline component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\n**Stories** to.\n### Import\n**Storybook Controls** helpers\nImport dereferenced component\n**JSON Schema** and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\n**Storybook Controls**, and parameterize **Storybook JSON Schema Addon**.\n### Import re-usable\nHeadline\n**Stories**...\nWe import the existing\nHeadline\n**Story** part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n### ... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\n**Story** defaults specific to our component.\n### Convert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\n### Create\nHeadline variants\nWe do this by binding to our\nTemplate, and use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\n**Storybook** now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nHeadline in all its glory!\n## Finished\n**Code Sandbox**\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\n**Code Sandbox**:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1"}, "lines": ["# Customize", "Headline component", "This guided example shows how you'd add components to your Design System that use a", "**kickstartDS** base component pretty directly.

Meaning: you start with some requirements, match an existing component, find a fitting new name for the use case, and give it a new purpose by greatly restricting and rewiring its options for the new context.\nEven while using the component rather directly from\nkickstartDS, you'll want to find the correct set of properties for your own use case. Components in kickstartDS come equipped with properties for a wide range of possible use cases, so it makes sense to reduce those to the ones you really need... to make components easier to understand, use and reason about!\nWe call this type of workflow\nCreation. Learn more about it in our dedicated guide about it. If you're unsure about something, have a look over there. We go into more background detail there about what we're doing here.\nNot touching the actual markup generated by components let's us get by without adding any custom styling (\nCSS / SCSS) to it. We simply reuse the already existing Design Token and component structure.\nOverview\nThis is how the result of this guide will look like:\nIt will only need three simple steps for that:\n- Component Definition,\n- Component Mapping, and\n- Component Creation\nFor more details about those steps, have a look at the guide about different component processes and their shared structure.\nRequirements\nThis guide assumes that you already have a working Design System, that is based on\nkickstartDS, running.\nIf that's not the case, follow our Create your Design System guide.\n1. Component Definition\nPurpose\nWe want to be able to flexibly tease content in a unified way. We think it should feel clean and modern, by looking like a card component. Otherwise, we'd just want to add the obvious things to such a card... headline, text, a link and optionally a cover image.\nIt would also be important to us that the component supports being inverted, as that's a feature we've used in other parts of our Design System extensively (for example our\nSection). Components working together nicely, and sharing the same overarching concepts is a key tenant of using a Design System!\nWe give our component the name\nTeaserCard.\nStructure\nDefining the structure of a component means finding the component API for it:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Headline for the teaser card|\n|Body text for the teaser card|\n|(Optional) image to display as cover|\n|Show inverted version of card?|\n|Target that should be linked|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\nWhile directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our\nJSON Schema later!\n2. Component Mapping\nNext we want to search for components that could be of use in assembling this new one. This might be a single, big component that more or less directly fits our use case, or alternatively a combination of components that could serve as the basis by combining them.\nThis will then serve as our\nkickstartDS base component, which will be adjusted to fit our needs!\nMatching it\nFrom a quick glance, our\nTeaserBox component seems like it might fit the bill quite nicely! It has options for a\nheadline (\ntopic),\ntext (\ntext),\ninverted (\ninverted) and\nimage (\nimage), and we can simplify its\nlink for our\ntarget.\nIt's\ninverted feature is also based on the general\nkickstartDS component and Design Token functionality, fulfilling that requirement of ours:\nFor a complete overview of the available options, take a look at the\nTeaserBox component API here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-teaser-box--linked-with-button\nAdjustments\nThis only gives us a rough sketch, though. We still need to adjust the example code to exactly fit our needs. In the process we will hard-code a bunch of options, because we're only interested in a specific set of them. The rest can be set to default values, which don't need to become part of the component API.\nStart with an existing\nTeaserBox component variant\nWe'll start by copying the\nJSX code for the\nLinked With Button variant of our\nTeaserBox component, from here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-teaser-box--linked-with-button\n_21\nRemove all of the unneeded stuff\nThere are a bunch of properties that are completely optional in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nIn the case of our\nTeaserCard, we drop\nratio and some of the\nlink options!\n_9\nHard-code static, required properties\nWe add\nRead more as the static text for the link included with our\nTeaserCard.\n_9\nAdd some demo content\nNow we just need to enter some \"real\" content, and we've successfully recreated what we set out to do in the start.

At least for the markup part!\n_21\nWith our small component API in place, and this rough sketch for the markup in mind, we can start actually implementing our component!\n3. Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/teaser-card, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/teaser-card\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute. The correct\n$id depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix\nhttp://schema.mydesignsystem.com.\nCreate\nheadline and\ntext fields...\nBoth fields are straight-forward\nstring type properties, so we just document them a bit!\nWe do mark\nheadline and\ntext by setting\nformat to\nmarkdown, though, to enable some light RTE-like formatting options of rendered text later on.\n... and make both required\nWe declare\nheadline and\ntext as required on the uppermost\nobject!\nCreate\ntarget and\nimage fields...\nBoth fields are also straight-forward\nstring type properties!\nWe do mark\ntarget and\nimage by setting\nformat to\nuri, this time enable URL-like behaviour for those fields.\n... and make\ntarget required\nWe add\ntarget as required on the uppermost\nobject!\nAdd\ninverted property\nAs the last property we add\ninverted, as a\nboolean.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nLet's have a look at our completed\nJSON Schema definition.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\nReact template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\nkickstartDS\nStorytelling component.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component. We're using TypeScript here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\nJSX (\n.jsx).\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nTeaserCardProps.ts. Generated by our\nJSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add\nHTMLAttributes to the type signature for the\nprops that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\nDestructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\nAdd\nTeaserCard component 1/5\nNow we'll import and add the\nkickstartDS\nTeaserBox component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the\nLinked With Button\nTeaserBox variant from our\nkickstartDS Design System.\nAdd\nTeaserCard component 2/5\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values\nundefined or\nnull in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nAdd\nTeaserCard component 3/5\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying\nkickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure\nprops first, so our own properties take precedence when set.\nAdd\nTeaserCard component 4/5\nWe renamed\ntopic to\nheadline in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form.\nAdd\nTeaserCard component 5/5\nFinally we add our hard coded\nRead More to the\nlink.label, and connect\ntarget to\nlink.href.\nAdd component\nProvider\nWe want our\nTeaserCard to replace all default\nkickstartDS base\nTeaserBoxes, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\nFinished\nReact template\nLet's have a look at our completed\nReact template.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component.

We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\nFinished\nReact template\nLet's have a look at our completed\nReact template.\nTo complete the template we add the\nTeaserBoxProvider to our\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx:\nThis concludes the creation of our new\nTeaserCard component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\nUse of\nStorybook\nIf you're using\nStorybook, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with kickstartDS!\nStorybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/teaser-card folder:\nImport\nTeaserCard component\nImport\nTeaserCard component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\nStories to.\nImport\nStorybook Controls helpers\nImport dereferenced component\nJSON Schema and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\nStorybook Controls, and parameterize Storybook JSON Schema Addon.\nImport re-usable\nTeaserCard\nStories...\nWe import the existing\nTeaserCard\nStory part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\nStory defaults specific to our component.\nConvert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\nJSON args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\nStorybook Controls get generated off.\nCreate\nTeaserCard variants\nWe do this by binding to our\nTemplate, and use\npack to convert all deep\nJSON args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\nStorybook Controls get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\nStorybook now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nTeaserCard in all its glory!\nFinished\nCode Sandbox\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\nCode Sandbox:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1", "markdown": "# Create\nTeaserCard component\nThis guided example show how to find a fitting, existing\n**kickstartDS** base component for one of your use cases, to repurpose it.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\"_21topic=\"Lorem Ipsum\"_21/>\nWith our small component API in place, and this rough sketch for the markup in mind, we can start actually implementing our component!\n## 3. Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/teaser-card, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/teaser-card\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Start with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\n**kickstartDS**.\n#### Add basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute. The correct\n$id depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix\nhttp://schema.mydesignsystem.com.\n#### Create\nheadline and\ntext fields...\nBoth fields are straight-forward\nstring type properties, so we just document them a bit!\nWe do mark\nheadline and\ntext by setting\nformat to\nmarkdown, though, to enable some light RTE-like formatting options of rendered text later on.\n#### ... and make both required\nWe declare\nheadline and\ntext as required on the uppermost\nobject!\n#### Create\ntarget and\nimage fields...\nBoth fields are also straight-forward\nstring type properties!\nWe do mark\ntarget and\nimage by setting\nformat to\nuri, this time enable URL-like behaviour for those fields.\n#### ... and make\ntarget required\nWe add\ntarget as required on the uppermost\nobject!\n#### Add\ninverted property\nAs the last property we add\ninverted, as a\nboolean.\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Start with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\n**kickstartDS**.\n#### Add basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\n**React** template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\n**kickstartDS**\nStorytelling component.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component. We're using **TypeScript** here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\n**JSX** (\n.jsx).\n#### Add correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nTeaserCardProps.ts. Generated by our\n**JSON Schema**, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with **TypeScript** this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> to the type signature for the\nprops that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\n#### Destructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\n#### Add\nTeaserCard component 1/5\nNow we'll import and add the\n**kickstartDS**\nTeaserBox component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the\n*Linked With Button*\nTeaserBox variant from our\n**kickstartDS** Design System.\n#### Add\nTeaserCard component 2/5\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values\nundefined or\nnull in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\n#### Add\nTeaserCard component 3/5\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying\n**kickstartDS** base component by just passing them through. We also destructure\nprops first, so our own properties take precedence when set.\n#### Add\nTeaserCard component 4/5\nWe renamed\ntopic to\nheadline in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form.\n#### Add\nTeaserCard component 5/5\nFinally we add our hard coded\n*Read More* to the\nlink.label, and connect\ntarget to\nlink.href.\n#### Add component\nProvider\nWe want our\nTeaserCard to replace all default\n**kickstartDS** base\nTeaserBoxes, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**React** template.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component.

We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**React** template.\nTo complete the template we add the\nTeaserBoxProvider to our\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx:\nThis concludes the creation of our new\nTeaserCard component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\n## Use of\n**Storybook**\nIf you're using\n**Storybook**, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with **kickstartDS**!\n##### Storybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/teaser-card folder:\n### Import\nTeaserCard component\nImport\nTeaserCard component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\n**Stories** to.\n### Import\n**Storybook Controls** helpers\nImport dereferenced component\n**JSON Schema** and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\n**Storybook Controls**, and parameterize **Storybook JSON Schema Addon**.\n### Import re-usable\nTeaserCard\n**Stories**...\nWe import the existing\nTeaserCard\n**Story** part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n### ... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\n**Story** defaults specific to our component.\n### Convert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\n### Create\nTeaserCard variants\nWe do this by binding to our\nTemplate, and use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\n**Storybook** now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nTeaserCard in all its glory!\n## Finished\n**Code Sandbox**\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\n**Code Sandbox**:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1"}, "lines": ["# Create", "TeaserCard component", "This guided example show how to find a fitting, existing", "**kickstartDS** base component for one of your use cases, to repurpose it.

It‚Äôs been roughly one year since we started to go to market by publishing our first website, and we are thrilled to now share the kickstartDS core with everyone in the Design System community.\nWhy have we decided to go Open Source?\nSome of you might have read my post on why we are creating kickstartDS. Today, I can proudly say that we reached the next big milestone of our mission to democratize Design Systems. Last year we started to implement kickstartDS for selected pilot customers, keeping the source behind closed doors. We wanted to validate technical decisions taken, and learn how developers interact and adapt kickstartDS.\nDuring that time, while doing user research, presenting our ideas and solutions to developers, we often heard that they really like it‚Ä¶ and that they would love to test it by directly installing ‚Äúthe package‚Äù. Well, who would go for a no-name, closed solution to build up something highly important like their Design System?\nOpen Source is the way! A couple of months ago we took the decision to share all our learnings and practices, wrapped up in the baseline of what kickstartDS is today. We want to continue that learning journey. That will be even easier with people working with kickstartDS independently, who hopefully also share their experiences and stories with us in the process. That is what we‚Äôd like to encourage users to do. Just try our setup guide‚Ä¶ and once you own your Design System based on kickstartDS, really make it your own. Tell us how you adapted it towards your individual needs, even how you named your components, how you get along with it adoption are super interesting to us! So please share it with us and the community.\nHelp democratize Design Systems!\nThe term Design System describes a broad topic, growing more and more momentum. Where large organizations today mostly have problems with the adoption or governance of theirs, in small to medium enterprises the problem often already is to get a Design System started at all. For example, when standard frameworks are too difficult or complex to adapt, when stakeholders need to be won in a time when frontend experts are a rare good. The approach is doomed and will lead to compromised technical solutions; consuming even more time and budget.\nToday quite some companies are already tackling similar problems. Talking of Knapsack.cloud, Backlight.dev, Specify, Supernova and many more, here. They all deliver value to simplify workflows for setup, integration, documentation and management of Design Systems. This is all super helpful in spreading the love about Design Systems to teams out there, and is a huge benefit to the process side of things.\nBut you usually still need to create or import all of your components, which means that you still have some hard work before to you yourself, before finally benefitting from these tools. There‚Äôs also a lot (knowledge and work) going into the setup of a Design System (semantic tokens, hardened components, etc) that‚Äôs not solved by those tools, yet.\nSetting up a code first Design System has never been easier\nTo help you getting started quickly, we created documentation guiding you through the installation process of your first Design System built with kickstartDS‚Ä¶ in just 5 rather simple steps.\nThe main steps will go as follows:\n- Start your Design System\n- Design Application\n- Configure Storybook\n- Add Components\n- Publish your Design System\nAlthough the resulting Design System will obviously not be finished by finishing these steps, you‚Äôll have everything set up to start on\nthe real work.\nThe essential part\nAt that point you already got rid of some of the core challenges. Plus, this might even give you the mental freedom to tackle the\nunique components to your organizations actual needs.\nThinking of such components ‚Ä¶ usually, every company has content to display. On their website, on marketing or landing pages, in their intranet or documentation, you name it. You can now start developing the perfect ‚ÄúHero Visual Component‚Äù with our basic Open Source components or you can skip even that by relying on our\ncomplex content components, which you can easily buy for a few bucks to add as additional building blocks for your freshly created Design System.\nThat package, additionally, really puts you in the driving seat‚Ä¶ speeding up the ride for even the most individual and complex cases you‚Äôll want to solve, the ‚Äúnext component your organization needs‚Äù. (this refers to Dan Mall‚Äôs talk on Converge‚Äô22, available through their registry here)\nWhat‚Äôs next?\nNow that kickstartDS is public we look ahead to its future with an open mind. We still have to work on many details to let our documentation really shine, for example. As we want to explain the underlying concepts in-depth. And since everyone is now free to install, test and use kickstartDS we believe in the great openness of the Design System community. We rely on your feedback by adapting to your needs, so that kickstartDS will really become the Design System starter digital teams like to work with.\nReleasing kickstartDS doesn‚Äôt mean that the development is completed. We have lots of ideas in mind. Features or modules which may find the way into the portfolio, thinking of telemetry, adapters, transformers and much more based on our\nComponent API.\nNot to forget: a Design System is nothing without systems using it!\nA Design System is there to generate value, to support the organization to better reach its objectives. Naturally there will be product or feature teams using it. About that, a 6th Step could and maybe even should be added to the setup process of the Design System.\nStep 6: Apply your Design System\nWhilst setting up kickstartDS you made quite a lot of decisions adapting the library to your organizations‚Äô specific needs.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/blog/why-we-created-kickstartds", "content": {"raw": "#tldr: We want to support you to create one library of components, patterns and tokens to be used in any frontend you need to give your digital touch points a consistent interface. Even shorter: we want to kickstart your design system implementation. üòé Now you might wonder if or why you need that.\nLet me provide some background. Jonas, founder of kickstartDS, and I have been working in the digital business all our professional life. We both have made our careers acting in different leading roles during the last two decades. Jonas from a development and tech perspective and I am from UX designers point of view. We both designed or coded patterns for the same things over and over again. Surely, we did rely on different frameworks in the past years. But never ever they met all our needs.\nIn the last years, when I was working for a huge software corporation I was involved in their design system initiative to help creating a unified library at scale, serving hundreds of interfaces. There was quite an energetic and enthusiastic team working on it and after a while we could proudly say that it was adapted globally. In the years before, any other attempt building a pattern library or design system language failed awfully. Mostly because of technical reasons, silo-thinking and poor possibilities to adapt into existing environments. And I heard about the same problems from a lot of people from my network.\nJonas on the other hand developed tons of websites and online shops served equally by dozens of different backend solutions, as you can imagine. In most cases the frontend parts were not quite re-usable for the next job. That already made him and the Ruhmesmeile team develop a pattern library which filled that gap being the base for new frontend projects.\nThe past and present\nIn all those years we crossed our paths often. Both living and working in the lovely city of Bonn in Germany. We met on meetups, lean coffees, agile events or conferences. We even once shared the offices in very early times as we were working for different companies. Helping and supporting each other with knowledge and tips at any of these times.\nWhen I stepped out of my former Job as UX Strategy Manager, I was looking to join or even create my own startup. A place where I could continue to follow the holistic UX approach of developing a user centric business and a happy place to apply ‚Äúnew work‚Äù principles. At that time Jonas and I met again, exchanging on what we are aiming for currently. Ruhmesmeile, the digital agency behind kickstartDS, was hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, clients stepped back from running projects and it was time to reform the organization.\nWith the ambitious idea of transforming it into a product-led company we decided to join forces and strive for the most modern solution to help SMEs and frontend development teams to build up their design systems putting\nfrontend first!\nThey just wrote JAM because it sounds better than MJAüòâ\nMarkup is really important. Whenever new projects are planned people discuss about APIs, backends and other infrastructural topics, but never really about the the frontend. Because often the user interface is a given thing.

And then there's combinations of those basic ones, to create more complex ones!\nWe try to give you an overview over the main, basic processes that can be involved when creating a component for your Design System. That doesn't mean that these are exclusively what you should do. There are other ways of approaching things, and it is highly encouraged to use components as you see fit. That extends to the ways you customize them, in the end we're just using widely accepted concepts and best practices that should never get into your way.\nNonetheless, there are some processes that we've found to be pretty universal. They also align really well with the way\nkickstartDS is built... reducing created technical debt, and minimizing overall effort required to get a good, consistent component in tune with your Design System:\nAll of these workflows currently involve using\nkickstartDS components as your foundation, even if customizing their React template in the process. It's completely possible to just use our conventions around having a component API (using JSON Schema) for structure, using Design Token and Component Token for design and layout and CSS / SCSS to connect both. And that last one is optional, you can use any approach to CSS, as long as you're using the semantic Design Token as required.\nThat way you completely and explicitly own how the template of a component is constructed, without involving any\nkickstartDS base components. Even better, you can stay compatible with them... as long as you have a matching component API (for example using exclusively your own markup for your\nButton, but being able to use it in all other existing\nkickstartDS base components by providing API compatibility through JSON Schema).\nEvery process is described in roughly the same way, this should helpfully aid in recognizing differences, while also finding your way around more efficiently. You can also freely combine all of those processes, as they are very similar in nature... and described with composability in mind.\nWe start by giving a short definition, followed by talking about the process itself a bit. This is always followed by descriptions of the two or three main steps involved. Finally we add some background info about the technical debt added that way, and link some example component guides that match that process type.\nEvery process has the steps \"Component Definition\" and \"Component Creation\". And in the case of creating a component, an additional step \"Component Mapping\".\nAccompanying each general guide is a corresponding example component guide, illustrating the process in detail for a demo component:\nAdapt a component: Adapt\nButtoncomponent\nCustomize a component: Customize\nHeadlinecomponent\nCreate a component: Create\nTeaserCardcomponent\nExtend a component: Extend\nSectioncomponent\nFour main processes\nSee below for a small description about the different proccesses. Each has its own dedicated general guide, and at least one example component guide illustrating it in detail.\nAdapt a component\nThis is the most basic way of building up a\nkickstartDS base component. We already have eyed up a specific component, that we want to adapt into our own Design System.\nWe just reduce the number of properties we use in our own adaptation of the selected component. We can also rename properties (to be a better fit for our own use), or even the component itself. It's pretty normal to end up with multiple components being based on the same\nkickstartDS base component in the end, but with each having a unique name and component API... thus fulfilling a much more specialized and semantic function in your Design System (for example having both a\nLinkButton and a\nNativeButton in your Design System, both based on the\nkickstartDS\nButton behind the scenes).\nGeneral structure:\n- Component Definition\n- Component Creation\nOur\nReact template imports kickstartDS components, and rewires them to our own component API.\nStart adapting\nkickstartDS components are meant to be specialized, but general purpose, components in that way. This is also the reason for every other of the processes including the expectation of also adapting the kickstartDS base components (or more specifically: their component API).\nCreate a component\nInstead of already having a\nkickstartDS base component in mind, we start with \"just\" a concept for a componnent.\nWe narrow that concept down, find a matching component in\nkickstartDS and then massage its properties to fit our use case, just like established by \"Adapt a component\".\nGeneral structure:\n- Component Definition\n- Component Mapping\n- Component Creation\nThe\nReact template imports kickstartDS components, and rewires them to our own component API.\nCustomize a component\nUnlike with adaptation, we do start out with a\nkickstartDS base component in mind. But it's still missing a crucial feature we need, or one of its features needs a little adjustment to work for us. This means while also following everything established by \"Adapt a component\", we potentially add new, custom properties to our component API that were not part of the original kickstartDS base component.\nGeneral structure:\n- Component Definition\n- Component Creation\nWe can't just re-use existing\nkickstartDS exports here. Instead we custommize the React template by copying the original markup and adding our own modifications on top.\nExtend a component\nWhile customizing a component allows adding or mutating functionality directly localized to your selected\nkickstartDS base component, we use composition when extending a component. To combine features of multiple kickstartDS base components, without actually changing React templates or markup.\nGeneral structure:\n- Component Definition\n- Component Creation\nWe import multiple\nkickstartDS base components for our React template, and rewire them to our own component API.\nGeneral guide structure\nAll the guides follow the same general structure. See below for a small description of the parts involved.\nComponent Definition\nThis is always started with a small intro, and introduces an example component that is used throughout that guide to illustrate the key concepts at play.\nIt's divided into two parts itself:\n- Purpose, and\n- Structure\nPurpose\nEvery component you add to your Design System should have a clear purpose. This section is about defining that purpose, and introduces the options and restrictions introduced by the chosen processes. We also define a fitting purpose for our example componnent.\nStructure\nFollowing the purpose, we narrow down on the options and fields our component will need to fulfill that purpose. How we actually go about that will depend on the chosen process again. But it will always end in explicitly writing down your components properties, each with a name (e.g.\nlabel), type (e.g.\nstring) and short description (e.g.\nText used on button).\nComponent Creation\nWe bring our structure to life here, by defining our components component API through\nJSON Schema. We then add a React template parameterized with those properties, wiring them up to kickstartDS base components as needed.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst a\nJSON Schema encoding your structure into a component API is created. This can range from copying existing, re-used properties from kickstartDS base components to writing wholly new schemas.\nReact template\nThe\nTypeScript types generated by our component API get used to create the JSX needed to render your component. This usually involves importing some kickstartDS base components. We then wire our properties to those base components. In the case of customizing a component we will not use the export / template of the customized base component... instead we copy its markup and add our modifications to it.\nComponent Mapping\nThis is (currently) only done as part of creating a component. It's where we take a component structure and match it to one or more existing\nkickstartDS base components.\nMatching it\nLook through all existing\nkickstartDS components, and find one or more matching the intended purpose and structure.\nAdjustments\nSome properties of our component API will probably not fit 1:1, so we'll rename and rewire them to fit our purpose.\nTechnical debt added\nDifferent ways of using components and best practices in\nkickstartDS, to create your own Design System, result in different technical debt being accrued. Simply using a kickstartDS components, maybe renaming a few of their properties, doesn't add much technical debt in the case of upgrades to kickstartDS, or your own code base... because they are minimally invasive in that sense.\nBut when customizing a component, and especially it's rendered markup, you inherit that technical debt. In case that component gets changed in the future, you will have to manage the migration. Changing the markup of a component means a Breaking Change in\nkickstartDS, and we will always provide a detailed migration guide in those cases... but it's more technical debt nontheless.\nWe try to illustrate the ways each proccess adds such technical debt to your Design System code base.\nExamples\nWe finish each guide with some example component guides that illustrate that process in practice and detail.", "markdown": "# Components\n## Overview\nThere are a lot of different basic ways of building a component with\n**kickstartDS**.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/packages", "content": {"raw": "Packages\nPackages in programming are commonly used to divide up code into distinctly (re-)usable blocks of functionality. (Almost) every programming language has its own version of handling packages, package dependencies and package installation. As we're using Node and\nJavaScript / TypeScript as our programming language of choice, our package registry will be npm. To read more about this topic, have a look at the \"Environment\" chapter of this section.\nOn this page, we'll try to give an overview to all the packages we've created in the context of working with Design Systems and\nkickstartDS.\nOverview\nkickstartDS is split into a bunch of different packages. This way you can pick and choose which parts you actually want to use in your own setup. Not every package will be used directly, as there are existing dependencies between those packages, too. For example adding\n@kickstartds/base to your project will automatically also add\n@kickstartds/core in an up-to-date and compatible version.\nPackages get published on\nnpm, you can see a full list here:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/org/kickstartds\nWe typically use different channels for different stabilities:\nlatestis connected to the\nmasterbranch on our mono-repository, always contains the latest stable release\nnextis connected to the\nnextbranch on our mono-repository, always contains the next feature release that's in preparation\nbetais connected to the\nbetabranch on our mono-repository, always contains the next breaking release that's in preparation\ncanaryis connected to all branches that have an active PR open on Github, and generates a Canary release specific to that branch, for isolated, early testing\nThis also aligns with our semantic versioning scheme. Breaking changes (\nX.0.0) mature through the\nbeta channel before being merged to\nlatest, feature releases (\n1.X.0) go through\nnext and fixes (\n1.0.X) land on\nlatest directly. As every change introduced to these channels will have gone through a PR on Github, it will also have included a Canary release for it. All branches auto release based on merged PRs\nAll releases get published on\nGithub, too. So you can also use that as a reference:\nhttps://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/releases\nTo learn more about\nAuto, Semantic Versioning and release handling you can read some background information on the \"Upgrading\" page, in the following section.\nWe've categorized all the packages existing (right now) below, so feel free to have a closer look!\nComponent modules\nThose are packages containing components to use as building blocks when creating your Design System. Every module is dependent on\n@kickstartds/core, for its shared core functionality. And all modules except\n@kickstartds/content are freely available to install right away. If you want to use our content module, have a look at the section about it below.\nWe try to slice modules by the use cases its components enable, or the type of interface built using them.\nCore module\n@kickstartds/core contains shared functionality, that get's consumed by other component modules implementing components. Every other component module will have\n@kickstartds/core as a dependency. Some of the things included:\n- Generally shared helper components (like\nContainerto build up container query based components)\n- Shared Client-side utilities / functionality (like\n_ks.radiofor event-based communication between components)\n- Base\nStorybookstories for Design Token(for those base token are the same in every Design System based on kickstartDS)\n- Helpers used to enrich components in\nStorybook(like automatically generating all the Controlsfor you)\n- Utilities to help constructing\nReacttemplates (like\ncreateProviderfor easy creation of\nkickstartDScomponent\nProviders)\nYou can find this package on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/core|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/tree/master/packages/components/core|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/blob/master/packages/components/core/CHANGELOG.md|\nBase module\n@kickstartds/base has all the obvious, and mostly simple, components.

It's also our first commercial component module, meaning it's not available to install freely. You have to get access to it on\nGithub and npm through acquiring a usage license from us.\nWe think this module is a nice addition when building your Design System, but it's in no way a necessity. By offering this as a paid module, we enable further development of\nkickstartDS... while also delivering great value in the components offered.

It's used to initialize and compile Design Token sets, generate\nTypeScript types for components and dereferenced JSON Schema files for you. To learn more about it, have a look at our \"CLI Usage\" page.\nYou can find the CLI on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/kickstartds|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\nkickstartDS Bundler\n@kickstartds/bundler contains the bundler we use internally when releasing ready-to-consume packages on\nnpm.\nThis includes (non-exhaustive):\n- Generating\nJSON Schemasready for consumption\n- Generating\nTypeScripttypes for auto-completion\n- Transpiling code to be browser-compatible\n- Generating\nCSSbundles from SCSS\nIf you're wondering how you'd do that in your own Design System, have a look at the final step of our main guide \"Create your Design System\". We describe one way to do it there, but this setup will always heavily depend on your specific set of circumstances... and the projects that you plan on using your Design System in.\nYou can find the bundler on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/bundler|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/tree/master/packages/tools/bundler|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/blob/master/packages/tools/bundler/CHANGELOG.md|\nStyle Dictionary integration\n@kickstartds/style-dictionary provides a directly re-usable\nStyle Dictionary configuration. Either consume a completely kickstartDS-compatible base config from this, or build up your own config using kickstartDS building blocks (like filters, formats, parsers and templates). Style Dictionary is used as a tool to manage your Design Token set. All your atomic design decisions get encoded in standardized JSON, ready to be transformed to all the outputs you might need. For kickstartDS this currently means converting your Design Token set to component-compatible CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables). Those, in turn, are used inside components by defining Component Token. But it could also mean exporting them in a format compatible with iOS, Android development, or to generate brand-compliant theming inputs for Material UI / MUI, Bootstrap or SAP Fiori.\nTo learn more about\nStyle Dictionary in general, visit their website.\nYou can find our\nStyle Dictionary utilities on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/style-dictionary|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/tree/master/packages/tools/style-dictionary|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/blob/master/packages/tools/style-dictionary/CHANGELOG.md|\nStorybook addons Storybook earns its own category here, because using Storybook as your Design Systems workbench is one of the core choices we made when creating kickstartDS. This is also implied when using kickstartDS for yourself, as our approach to development utilizies, and profits from, Storybooks immensely. Case in point: we've written some addons for Storybook to bridge the gap between kickstartDS-specific implementation choices (like using JSON Schema or Component Token) and your general, known usage of Storybook to test and develop components.\nWe still try to write those addons in a way that they're useful outside of\nkickstartDS, too. But they're especially useful when combined!\nJSON Schema addon\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema is an addon we wrote to display\nJSON Schema documentation for your component API, including a validating JSON Code Editor with semantic auto-complete, the ability to interact with your components, and copy configurations with ease.\nTo learn more about this addon, view our dedicated integrations page about it.\nYou can find this addon on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\nComponent Token addon\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens is an addon we wrote to display\nComponent Token directly alongside your component in Storybook. This enables you to inspect token assignment or layering, you can even experiment by changing tokens around and testing the result by browsing through the rest of your Storybook (changes to your tokens made this way are persisted for your browser session).\nTo learn more about this addon, view our dedicated integrations page about it.\nYou can find this addon on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-component-tokens|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-component-tokens/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\nConfiguration packages\nAll the packages listed here include ready-to-use configuration for coding best practices, and tools related to that (e.g. linting with\nESLint or Stylelint). Those are the configurations we use when developing kickstartDS itself, but it can make a lot of sense of just using them for your own Design System, too. Especially if you don't need anything super special, or don't feel like implementing it yourself.\nAuto configuration\n@kickstartds/auto-config contains a configuration for\nAuto, a tool to generate releases based on semantic version labels on pull requests. Learn more on their Github or dedicated website for the tool. We use this ourselves, to generate releases for all of our npm packages. Have a look at part 5 of \"Create your Design System\" for a deeper look on how this can work for your own Design System.\nYou can find this config on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/auto-config|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/tree/master/packages/auto|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/blob/master/packages/auto/CHANGELOG.md|\nESLint configuration\n@kickstartds/eslint-config contains the\nESLint config we use when developing code. It enables consistent code formatting for JavaScript / TypeScript, and in the process reduces diffs when changing code. It also recommends best practices, and helps avoid using bad code patterns. We use\nairbnb-base and\nprettier as a baseline, with some slight mutations for our own use.\nYou can easily re-use this for your own Design System! Learn more about\nESLint on their dedicated website.\nYou can find this config on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/eslint-config|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/tree/master/packages/eslint|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/blob/master/packages/eslint/CHANGELOG.md|\nStylelint configuration\n@kickstartds/stylelint-config holds the\nStylelint config we use for our CSS and SCSS authoring. It does pretty much the same for CSS as ESLint does for your JavaScript / TypeScript. Like with\n@kickstartds/eslint-config we haven't reinvented the wheel here. We're basing off of\nstandard-scss,\nsass-guidelines and\nprettier.\nAs with\n@kickstartds/eslint-config, you can easily re-use this for your own Design System! Learn more about\nStylelint on their dedicated website.\nYou can find this config on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/stylelint-config|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/tree/master/packages/stylelint|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/blob/master/packages/stylelint/CHANGELOG.md|\nkickstartDS packages\nThe following packages are used for our own purposes. For example to create our main marketing page, our documentation, our branded\nStorybook, and so on. These can be interesting to see how we've used kickstartDS ourselves. This currently (in a published form) includes the repository containing our own Storybook instance / Design System.\nkickstartDS Design System\n@kickstartds/design-system is our Design System, and includes all of our\nkickstartDS branded component versions. This can be a great place to find inspiration, as we've used the concepts described throughout this documentation ourselves, to build up our own website.\nYou can find it here:\n|Category||Link|\n|Hosted |Storybook |https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/design-system|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-storybook|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-storybook/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md|\nMisc packages\nThis leaves us with some packages that can't quite fit the categories above. Currently this is only\n@kickstartds/json-schema-viewer, which gets utilized by our\nJSON Schema addon (\nstorybook-addon-jsonschema).\nJSON Schema viewer\n@kickstartds/json-schema-viewer is a fork of\natlassian/json-schema-viewer. We forked that project to update the bundling to enable compiling it for the browser, and export some components more directly for consumption.

It's used to initialize and compile Design Token sets, generate\n**TypeScript** types for components and dereferenced **JSON Schema** files for you. To learn more about it, have a look at our \"CLI Usage\" page.\nYou can find the CLI on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/kickstartds|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\n**kickstartDS** Bundler\n@kickstartds/bundler contains the bundler we use internally when releasing ready-to-consume packages on\n**npm**.\nThis includes (non-exhaustive):\n- Generating\nJSON Schemasready for consumption\n- Generating\nTypeScripttypes for auto-completion\n- Transpiling code to be browser-compatible\n- Generating\nCSSbundles from SCSS\nIf you're wondering how you'd do that in your own Design System, have a look at the final step of our main guide \"Create your Design System\".

Either consume a completely **kickstartDS**-compatible base config from this, or build up your own config using **kickstartDS** building blocks (like filters, formats, parsers and templates). **Style Dictionary** is used as a tool to manage your **Design Token** set. All your atomic design decisions get encoded in standardized JSON, ready to be transformed to all the outputs you might need. For **kickstartDS** this currently means converting your Design Token set to component-compatible CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables). Those, in turn, are used inside components by defining Component Token. But it could also mean exporting them in a format compatible with **iOS**, **Android** development, or to generate brand-compliant theming inputs for **Material UI** / **MUI**, **Bootstrap** or **SAP Fiori**.\nTo learn more about\n**Style Dictionary** in general, visit their website.\nYou can find our\n**Style Dictionary** utilities on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/style-dictionary|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/tree/master/packages/tools/style-dictionary|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS/blob/master/packages/tools/style-dictionary/CHANGELOG.md|\n**Storybook** addons **Storybook** earns its own category here, because using **Storybook** as your Design Systems workbench is one of the core choices we made when creating **kickstartDS**. This is also implied when using **kickstartDS** for yourself, as our approach to development utilizies, and profits from, **Storybooks** immensely. Case in point: we've written some addons for **Storybook** to bridge the gap between **kickstartDS**-specific implementation choices (like using **JSON Schema** or **Component Token**) and your general, known usage of **Storybook** to test and develop components.\nWe still try to write those addons in a way that they're useful outside of\n**kickstartDS**, too. But they're especially useful when combined!\n**JSON Schema** addon\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema is an addon we wrote to display\n**JSON Schema** documentation for your component API, including a validating JSON Code Editor with semantic auto-complete, the ability to interact with your components, and copy configurations with ease.\nTo learn more about this addon, view our dedicated integrations page about it.\nYou can find this addon on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\n**Component Token** addon\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens is an addon we wrote to display\n**Component Token** directly alongside your component in **Storybook**. This enables you to inspect token assignment or layering, you can even experiment by changing tokens around and testing the result by browsing through the rest of your **Storybook** (changes to your tokens made this way are persisted for your browser session).\nTo learn more about this addon, view our dedicated integrations page about it.\nYou can find this addon on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens|\n|Its own |Github repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-component-tokens|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/storybook-addon-component-tokens/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md|\n## Configuration packages\nAll the packages listed here include ready-to-use configuration for coding best practices, and tools related to that (e.g. linting with\n**ESLint** or **Stylelint**). Those are the configurations we use when developing **kickstartDS** itself, but it can make a lot of sense of just using them for your own Design System, too. Especially if you don't need anything super special, or don't feel like implementing it yourself.\n**Auto** configuration\n@kickstartds/auto-config contains a configuration for\n**Auto**, a tool to generate releases based on semantic version labels on pull requests. Learn more on their Github or dedicated website for the tool. We use this ourselves, to generate releases for all of our **npm** packages. Have a look at part 5 of \"Create your Design System\" for a deeper look on how this can work for your own Design System.\nYou can find this config on:\n|Category||Link|\nnpm package registry |https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kickstartds/auto-config|\n|Our |Github mono-repository |https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/tree/master/packages/auto|\n|https://github.com/kickstartDS/config/blob/master/packages/auto/CHANGELOG.md|\n**ESLint** configuration\n@kickstartds/eslint-config contains the\n**ESLint** config we use when developing code. It enables consistent code formatting for **JavaScript** / **TypeScript**, and in the process reduces diffs when changing code. It also recommends best practices, and helps avoid using bad code patterns. We use\nairbnb-base and\nprettier as a baseline, with some slight mutations for our own use.\nYou can easily re-use this for your own Design System!

It does pretty much the same for **CSS** as **ESLint** does for your **JavaScript** / **TypeScript**. Like with\n@kickstartds/eslint-config we haven't reinvented the wheel here. We're basing off of\nstandard-scss,\nsass-guidelines and\nprettier.\nAs with\n@kickstartds/eslint-config, you can easily re-use this for your own Design System!

For example to create our main marketing page, our documentation, our branded\n**Storybook**, and so on. These can be interesting to see how we've used **kickstartDS** ourselves. This currently (in a published form) includes the repository containing our own **Storybook** instance / Design System.\n**kickstartDS** Design System\n@kickstartds/design-system is our Design System, and includes all of our\n**kickstartDS** branded component versions.

This mostly includes components that are needed in every Design System, and that typically also get added with the same name (like our\nButton here).\nEven while directly using the component, including its name, from\nkickstartDS, you'll want to find the correct set of properties for your own use case. Components in kickstartDS come equipped with properties for a wide range of possible use cases, so it makes sense to reduce those to the ones you really need... to make components easier to understand, use and reason about!\nWe call this type of workflow\nAdaptation. Learn more about it in our dedicated guide about it. If you're unsure about something, have a look over there. We go into more background detail there about what we're doing here.\nNot touching the actual markup generated by components let's us get by without adding any custom styling (\nCSS / SCSS) to it. We simply reuse the already existing Design Token and component structure.\nOverview\nThis is how the result of this guide will look like:\nIt will only need two simple steps for that:\n- Component Definition, and\n- Component Creation\nFor more details about those steps, have a look at the guide about different component processes and their shared structure.\nRequirements\nThis guide assumes that you already have a working Design System, that is based on\nkickstartDS, running.\nIf that's not the case, follow our Create your Design System guide.\n1. Component Definition\nPurpose\nThere are some straight foward things we'd want to do with a button in our Design System. Most obvious ones would probably be putting a\nlabel on it, and making the\ntarget of it available for users. If the\ntarget is set, the resulting button should look like one, but use the\na tag semantically. It should just be a styled, but native,\n otherwise.\nAdditionally we'll want to be able to influence the\nsize of a button, and be able to choose from a limited set of\nvariants. We'll use the options offered by\nkickstartDS 1:1 for the\nsize property (\nsmall,\nmedium,\nlarge). But for\nvariant we opt to define our own naming, further removing how a button looks from the naming scheme (like\noutline,\nclear, etc) and going for straight priority with\nprimary,\nsecondary and\ntertiary.\nFinally, being able to mark a button as\ndisabled should be possible!\nStructure\nDefining the structure of a component means finding the component API for it:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Label shown on the button|\n|Target that should be linked|\n|Variant of button used|\n|Size the button should be shown in|\n|Whether the button should be shown as disabled|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\nWhile directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our\nJSON Schema later!\n2. Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/button, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/button\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this\nJSON Schema definition.\nStart with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\nkickstartDS.\nAdd basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute. The correct\n$id depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix\nhttp://schema.mydesignsystem.com.\nCreate\nlabel and\ntarget fields...\nBoth fields are straight-forward\nstring type properties, so we just document them a bit!\nWe do mark\ntarget by setting\nformat to\nuri, though, to enable validation later on.\n... and make\nlabel required\nWe declare\nlabel as required on the uppermost\nobject!\nAdd allowed\nsizes 1/2\nWe add a\nsize property of type\nstring...\nAdd allowed\nsizes 2/2\n... and make it an\nenum, defining its available options explicitly.

We also set a\ndefault.\nAdd\ndisabled property\nFinally, we add a property\ndisabled, of type\nboolean.\nFinished\nJSON Schema\nLet's have a look at our completed\nJSON Schema definition.\nThis concludes creating the\nJSON Schema. When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\nReact template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\nkickstartDS\nStorytelling component.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component. We're using TypeScript here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\nJSX (\n.jsx).\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nButtonProps.ts. Generated by our\nJSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also include and forward a reference to the underlying\n with\nforwardRef, and allow\nHTMLAttributes to be passed to the root element.\nDestructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We add our\ndefault values here, too. We'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\nAdd\nButton component 1/5\nNow we'll import and add the\nkickstartDS\nButton component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the solid\nButton variant from our\nkickstartDS Design System.\nAdd\nButton component 2/5\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values\nundefined or\nnull in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nAdd\nButton component 3/5\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying\nkickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure\nprops first, so our own properties take precedence when set, and pass\nref off to the base component.\nAdd\nButton component 4/5\nWe renamed\nhref to\ntarget in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form.\nAdd\nButton component 5/5\nFinally we have to remap the values for\nvariant, because we've actually renamed the values here.\nAdd component\nProvider\nWe want our\nButton to replace all default\nkickstartDS base\nButtons, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\nFinished\nReact template\nLet's have a look at our completed\nReact template.\nFinished\nReact template\nWe'll work our way up to this\nReact template.\nStart with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\nReact component.

It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\nUse of\nStorybook\nIf you're using\nStorybook, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with kickstartDS!\nStorybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/button folder:\nImport\nButton component\nImport\nButton component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\nStories to.\nImport\nStorybook Controls helpers\nImport dereferenced component\nJSON Schema and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\nStorybook Controls, and parameterize Storybook JSON Schema Addon.\nImport re-usable\nButton\nStories...\nWe import the existing\nButton\nStory part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\nStory defaults specific to our component.\nConvert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\nJSON args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values.

This is the format your\nStorybook Controls get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\nStorybook now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nButton in all its glory!\nFinished\nCode Sandbox\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\nCode Sandbox:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1\n_1", "markdown": "# Adapt\nButton component\nThis guided example shows how you'd often add components to your Design System that use a\n**kickstartDS** base component pretty directly.

This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (\n.jsx /\n.tsx), potential CSS / SASS (\n.css /\n.scss), JavaScript (\n.js /\n.ts), our JSON Schema component definition (\n.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory\nsrc/components/button, from our Design System repository root:\n_1mkdir -p src/components/button\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nFirst file we'll create is the\nJSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Start with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\n**kickstartDS**.\n#### Add basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute. The correct\n$id depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix\nhttp://schema.mydesignsystem.com.\n#### Create\nlabel and\ntarget fields...\nBoth fields are straight-forward\nstring type properties, so we just document them a bit!\nWe do mark\ntarget by setting\nformat to\nuri, though, to enable validation later on.\n#### ... and make\nlabel required\nWe declare\nlabel as required on the uppermost\nobject!\n#### Add allowed\nsizes 1/2\nWe add a\nsize property of type\nstring...\n#### Add allowed\nsizes 2/2\n... and make it an\nenum, defining its available options explicitly. We also set a\ndefault.\n#### Add allowed\nvariants 1/2\nWe add a\nvariant property of type\nstring...\n#### Add allowed\nvariants 2/2\n... and make it an\nenum, defining its available options explicitly. We also set a\ndefault.\n#### Add\ndisabled property\nFinally, we add a property\ndisabled, of type\nboolean.\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**JSON Schema** definition.\n#### Start with just the boilerplate for a component definition\nThis includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in\n**kickstartDS**.\n#### Add basic info describing component\nWe start by adding a\ntitle,\ndescription and\n$id attribute.

We also set a\ndefault.\n#### Add\ndisabled property\nFinally, we add a property\ndisabled, of type\nboolean.\n#### Finished\n**JSON Schema**\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**JSON Schema** definition.\nThis concludes creating the\nJSON Schema. When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nHow your schema generation is started might change depending on your setup. If you've followed our \"Create your Design System\" guide before, or want to add it like we do, follow this section of it closely.\n**React** template\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional\nReact component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the\nJSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the\n**kickstartDS**\nStorytelling component.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component. We're using **TypeScript** here (\n.tsx), but it works the same with plain\n**JSX** (\n.jsx).\n#### Add correct typings\nImport and add generated props from\nButtonProps.ts. Generated by our\n**JSON Schema**, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with **TypeScript** this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also include and forward a reference to the underlying\n<button> with\nforwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement | HTMLBUttonElement>, and allow\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> to be passed to the root element.\n#### Destructure\nprops\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure\nprops. We add our\ndefault values here, too. We'll just pass through everything\nHTMLAttributes related!\n#### Add\nButton component 1/5\nNow we'll import and add the\n**kickstartDS**\nButton component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the solid\nButton variant from our\n**kickstartDS** Design System.\n#### Add\nButton component 2/5\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values\nundefined or\nnull in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the\ndefault value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\n#### Add\nButton component 3/5\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying\n**kickstartDS** base component by just passing them through. We also destructure\nprops first, so our own properties take precedence when set, and pass\nref off to the base component.\n#### Add\nButton component 4/5\nWe renamed\nhref to\ntarget in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form.\n#### Add\nButton component 5/5\nFinally we have to remap the values for\nvariant, because we've actually renamed the values here.\n#### Add component\nProvider\nWe want our\nButton to replace all default\n**kickstartDS** base\nButtons, no matter where they appear. We add a\nProvider for that purpose now!\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nLet's have a look at our completed\n**React** template.\n#### Finished\n**React** template\nWe'll work our way up to this\n**React** template.\n#### Start with a boilerplate\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our\n**React** component.

It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\n## Use of\n**Storybook**\nIf you're using\n**Storybook**, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with **kickstartDS**!\n##### Storybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your Design System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and configuration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your\nsrc/components/button folder:\n### Import\nButton component\nImport\nButton component and add it to the\nTemplate that we'll bind\n**Stories** to.\n### Import\n**Storybook Controls** helpers\nImport dereferenced component\n**JSON Schema** and\ngetArgsShared helper to generate\n**Storybook Controls**, and parameterize **Storybook JSON Schema Addon**.\n### Import re-usable\nButton\n**Stories**...\nWe import the existing\nButton\n**Story** part of\n@kickstartDS/base, to re-use all the default settings.\n### ... and overwrite values where needed\nWe set all the\n**Story** defaults specific to our component.\n### Convert args to flat keys\nWe use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\n### Create\nButton variants\nWe do this by binding to our\nTemplate, and use\npack to convert all deep\n**JSON** args to flat (\n. delimited) keys and values. This is the format your\n**Storybook Controls** get generated off.\nIf you reopen your\n**Storybook** now, or if you kept it running while following along, you should now see your new\nButton in all its glory!\n## Finished\n**Code Sandbox**\nYou can also have a look at the completed component in the following\n**Code Sandbox**:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n_1\n_1"}, "lines": ["# Adapt", "Button component", "This guided example shows how you'd often add components to your Design System that use a", "**kickstartDS** base component pretty directly.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli", "content": {"raw": "kickstartDS CLI\nAbout\nThe\nkickstartDS CLI helps ease everyday tasks when working with Design Systems, especially when building on and with kickstartDS.\nIt currently supports two main categories of commands:\nSchema: Generate TypeScripttypes for components, or dereference component JSON Schema Token: Initialize Style Dictionaryusing Branding Token, or build prepared Style Dictionaryplatforms and formats for your token set\nCommands can generally be divided into the following types:\n- Commands that\nthinly wrap other APIs or toolingfor you (for example Style Dictionarycommands within the\ntokenscategory), enabling zero-config use when following our recommended structure for your project\n- Commands\nautomating tasks for you(for example creating TypeScripttypes for your components, or dereferencing them, within the\nschemacategory), which helps keep your project free from scripts for those tasks\n- Commands meant to\nreduce the amount of scaffoldingyou'll have to write manually. We're currently working on those!\nWe generally strive for all the commands to work with zero config when following the project structure outlined in our documentation for your own Design System (it's also the same one used in our starter). But we also try to expose options to change those values as needed, you shouldn't ever\nneed to follow our structure. If there's an option that's missing for your use case, feel free to contact us so when can add it!\nWe also include support for\nshell completions. Though those will probably still need some more intimate knowledge with your terminal and shell setup, they can be a nice addition to explore available commands and options!\nInstallation\nYou'll need to have\nNode.js installed to use our CLI, see our page about the expected environment when working with kickstartDS for details. kickstartDS CLI has to be installed for use with Node.js, which can be done through all the common package managers. You can either install it globally, or as a dependency of your Design System project.\nInstall in project\nInstalling the\nCLI as part of your Design System projects helps keeping the version used across your team and consumers consistent. We generally advise going this route, and wiring up your local\npackage.json scripts entries to those commands for isolation.\nHave a look at part 2 of our main guide \"Create your Design System\", for a more detailed explanation of this setup.\nAlternatively you can use the\nCLI directly, without installing it, by using\nnpx, like this:\n_1npx tokens init\nLearn more about\nnpx as an option to run commands globally, without installation, in the npm Docs.\nInstall globally with\nnpm or Yarn\nkickstartDS CLI is available as a npm package. If you have\nNode.js available, you can install it by running:\n_1npm install kickstartds@latest -g\nor if using\nYarn:\n_1yarn global add kickstartds\nIf you're encountering problems with this, or for more details on the technical setup needed to work with\nkickstartDS, see our Getting Started page about the environment needed.\nInstall as a part of a\nkickstartDS Design System\nThis is the preferred way of integrating the\nkickstartDS CLI into your workflow. It gives you the ability to fix the version of the CLI in use to the exact corresponding kickstartDS package versions, added as a dependency to your Design System. It also allows using the CLI in multiple projects, without those interferring with each other through a globally installed, shared dependency.\nAll that said: we're being really careful with changes to the\nCLI, so it should only ever need to be upgraded when changing to a new breaking release of kickstartDS itself. You might still want to upgrade earlier to get access to fixes (\nX.X.3) or new features (\nX.2.X). See our page about\nUpgrading to learn more about our release process, and our versioning scheme!\nThe preferred way to install the\nCLI to your Design System project would be as a\ndevDependency.\n_1yarn add -D kickstartds\nSee the following code snippet for an example of a typical (abridged) example of a\npackage.json for a Design System project utilizing the\nkickstartDS CLI:\nWe have\n@kickstartds/base as our main\nkickstartDS package dependency, and\nkickstartds (the\nkickstartDS CLI) as a\ndevDependency. We also include\nReact to complete our\ndependencies, while\nchokidar-cli and\nnpm-run-all help us glue together\nkickstartDS CLI commands with our local\nscripts entries, as the remaining\ndevDependencies.\nThere are three integration types at play here: 1. Wire up a\nscript entry to a\nCLI command directly (optionally setting parameters as required), 2. Run select\nscripts in parallel (using\nnpm-run-all) to improve DX, by grouping commands commonly used together, and 3. Watch for file changes, to subsequently trigger a\nscript entry... enabling a\nwatch / hot reload mode (using\nchokidar-cli).\nFor a more detailed description of what all those commands do, have a look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nGetting started\nOnce you've installed the\nkickstartDS CLI, you can verify everything works as expected by running the following command:\n_1kickstartDS --help\nYou'll notice the version of the\nCLI used is part of the logs, written by every command you run. This can help narrow down problems when debugging errors. You can also get the version by calling\n--version directly:\n_1kickstartDS --version\nThe\nCLI should generally be pretty explorable by itself, so feel free to just follow the output provided by\n--help to find out about about commands, options, etc.\nThere are some general options that can be included with every command, and you can integrate the\nCLI with your terminal / shell, too. We'll explore both in the two upcoming sections.\nGeneral options\nThe following options each influence how your command will be run, and can be used with all commands included:\n|Option||Default Value||Description|\n|Adds additional debug output to the logging|\n|Don't quote the user for input, read from environment and parameters|\n|Inverse of the command, useful for reverting unwanted changes|\n|Clean up temporary folders used first|\nIf an option is not set the default value will be used for it. To learn more about\n--cleanup,\n--revert and\n--rc-only have a look at the features section below.\nSetting up shell completions\nYou can set up local shell completions for your terminal by simply calling the\ncompletion install command:\n_1kickstartDS completion install\nYou can also remove completions again by using the inverse\ncompletion remove:\n_1kickstartDS completion remove\nWe use\nomelette under the hood to enable the completion features, see their section about\nAutomated Install for details on how this is achieved for different shell flavours. This can be especially helpful if something is not working out-of-the-box for you!\nShell support\nThis is a really early feature. As there are a lot of different terminal and shell combinations out there, we pretty much expect this to still be pretty unstable, because it is not widely tested.\nWe'd love to hear your experience (Did it work? Did it to what you expected?), so we can continue improving this!\nFeatures\nNext to General options there's also some more general features in use throughout all\nCLI commands. Read through the following paragraphs for details on those features, what they're used for, and how you can use them.\nInteractive prompts and\n.rc files\nThough not in use for the basic commands implemented currently, every command can specify a corresponding\n.rc file to set options to be used by default. If not using\n.rc files (this is toggled through the general option\n--rc-only,\ntrue by default), or if the\n.rc file is missing some required parameters, you'll be prompted for those interactively.\nTo have a reliable structure when doing this, and to easily provide defaults when omitted, we've opted to add\nJSON Schema definitions for all of our commands. This is the one defining\nkickstartDS tokens compile: https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli/blob/next/.tokens-compilerc.schema.json\nThere's also a base config included for every command, which provides the defaults in case\n--rc-only is supplied without a local\n.rc file in your project, or if that\n.rc file is missing some values. This is the one corresponding to the default\n.rc file for\nkickstartDS tokens compile from above: https://github.com/kickstartDS/kickstartDS-cli/blob/next/.tokens-compilerc.json\nInteractive prompts for commands are generated dynamically based on the supplied\nJSON Schema, using\nname,\ntype,\ndefault and\ndescription from the definition, to help make useful choices. Especially\ntype is used to present prompts semantically, using Inquirer.js. Defaults are first pulled from your local\n.rc file (even if using\n--rc-only set to\nfalse, to have better contextual defaults presented to you), and then the fallback\n.rc file provided by\nkickstartDS.\ne.g. https://github.com/leonzalion/inquirer-press-to-continue\nThis setup provides a scalable approach to creating commands that can both work in a zero config way, while also being able to overwrite configuration (even if only granularly)... even in the most complex scenarios. It also allows persisting your configuration as part of your repository, so you can always repeat the exact process, or review the choices you made when running something like\nkickstartDS tokens init.\nTemporary folders\nEverything needed to complete a command will be copied to a temporary folder, first. Results will then be copied back to your project / execution context if, and only if, the command that was run completed successfully.\nThis ensures changes will be done in isolation, in a controlled environment. Additionally this avoids corrupting your project with output resulting from a failed command.\nEvery command and subcommand combination uses a unique folder name combination to avoid conflicts when mulitple commands are run (e.g.\ntokens-init-init-task for the\ninit subcommand of the\ntokens command).\nThe exact location of the temporary folder used depends on your OS, but it should be part of the log output when running a command... e.g.:\n_1[init: cleanup] info: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-init-init-task before starting command\nHere\n/tmp/tokens-init-init-task would be the temporary folder in question on a\nArch Linux OS (for macOS this slightly differs, for example).\nRevertability\nWe strive to implement a corresponding revert / rollback variant for every command, behind the\n--revert switch. This in part works by using the aforementioned temporary folder.\nWhile having such a general structure in place is necessary, it's also required to write commands in a way that the original starting point is preserved inside the temporary folder. This is something to be done by the author of new commands, and needs great care!\nAdditionally, having a\n--revert variant available may not always be feasible or sensible. Those commands\nnot having such a variant will be explicitly marked, including a short reasoning for not implementing it.\nCurrently testing\nThe\n--revert variants of the tasks implemented so far are currently being tested. If you're stumbling over one not working as expected, please feel free to open an issue on our Github.\nAvailable commands\nAs hinted at before, commands are generally split into categories by some shared concept or use case. We currently have categories for\nDesign Token (\ntoken) and\nJSON Schema (\nschema).\nToken category: Commands around working with your Design Token set.\n|Command||Subcommand||Description|\n|Initialize your |Design Token set from Branding Token\n|Compile your |Design Token set into all configured Style Dictionary formats / outputs\n|Sync your |Design Token set to Figma (work in progress) Schema category: Commands around working with your JSON Schema.\n|Command||Subcommand||Description|\n|Create |TypeScript types matching your components JSON Schema\n|Dereference |JSON Schema files for easier consumption\nBoth categories and their subcommands will be described in a bit more detail below.\nDesign Token commands\nCommands in this category are used to deal with every type of token present in your Design System. Namely\nBranding Token for initial token set generation, Design Token managed in Style Dictionary, and Component Token used by your components.\nFor a detailed setup guide for everything related to\nDesign Token, give part 2 of \"Create your Design System\" a visit.\ntokens init\nInitializes your\nDesign Token set from a Branding Token file. Includes options to specify a specific file path for your branding token file (\n--branding-token-path), and a path for the dictionary (\n--token-dictionary-path), to set the location to store your\nDesign Token set.\nSee the section \"2. Design Application\" > \"Initialization\" of our main guide \"Create your Design System\" to learn more about this setup.\nAvailable options:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your branding token file|\n|relative path from project root to your token dictionary|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\ntokens compile\nTakes your\nDesign Token set (a collection of JSON files in Style Dictionary format), and compiles them to a set of different output formats.\nInternally a configuration file for\nStyle Dictionary (\nsd.config.cjs format) is included, that defines a base set of formats (\njsx,\nstorybook) to be used when no local configuration file is found in your project. You can find the responsible code for this here in our repository, for reference.\nThe resulting files are saved to the locations specified (per format) either by the included\nStyle Dictionary config, or by the one provided inside your project (\nsd.config.cjs), the location of your\nDesign Token set you can use\n--token-dictionary-path.\nSee the section \"2. Design Application\" > \"Compile Design Token set\" of our main guide \"Create your Design System\" to learn more about this setup.\nAvailable options:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your token dictionary|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\ntokens tofigma\nTakes your\nDesign Token set (a collection of JSON files in Style Dictionary format), and syncs them to a clone of our Figma token file.\nYou can configure the location of your\nDesign Token set by using\n--token-dictionary-path.\nWork in progress\nThis command is currently work in progress. It will support syncing your\nDesign Token set / Style Dictionary to a copy of our Design Token template for Figma. When this command is finished, we'll add the other direction (\nfromfigma), too. This will enable you to always keep\nDesign Token in sync between code and design!\nStatus:\nJSON Schema matching our Figma template down to every label, layer and description. Can already be used to validate the structure of a Figma file. Next up will be pulling the values out from the Figma template instance, to transform and write them to your Design Token set. Available options:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your token dictionary|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\nJSON Schema commands\nEvery component based on\nkickstartDS includes a JSON Schema definition for its component API. Commands in the\nschema category help transform those definitions into other helpful formats like\nTypeScript types, or deferenced versions of the schema.\nschema types\nGenerate\nTypeScript types for your components, matching your component API / JSON Schema exactly. These types can then be used when implementing your React template, providing a stable base to rely upon. Generated type definitions are put alongside the JSON Schema files, into the components directory.\nYou can set the path components are placed inside your Design System using\n--components-path, if you're not using the directory structure presumed in our guides, examples and starter. You'll always have to provide a domain that is used in your\nJSON Schema definitions by specifying\n--schema-domain (e.g.\n--schema-domain schema.mydomain.com).\nSee our component example guide \"Adapt\nButton component\", especially the end of section \"\nJSON Schema definition\" and the subsequent section on the \" React template\" for an example of this at work. Available options:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your components directory|\n|domain used in your JSON Schema $id fields|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\nschema dereference\nJSON Schema definitions for component APIs can (and often do) include references to other component definitions. This is done by the way of using a\n$ref in one of the properties, or by using advanced workflows involving\nallOf,\nanyOf,\noneOf and so forth.\nBecause we generate\nStorybook Controls and documentation for all of the properties of a component (including the referenced ones), we use this command to \"dereference\" all of those keywords. This results in a dereferenced version of the JSON Schema with all references resolved and inlined. This can then be used then without involving complex, or computationally expensive, conversions on the client.\nYou can set the path components are placed inside your Design System using\n--components-path, if you're not using the directory structure presumed in our guides, examples and starter. You'll always have to provide a domain that is used in your\nJSON Schema definitions by specifying\n--schema-domain (e.g.\n--schema-domain schema.mydomain.com).\nFollow the links to learn more about the integrations we provide for\nStorybook in general, or Storybook Controls specifically. See the following example on Github to see such a dereferenced schema at work. Available options:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your components directory|\n|domain used in your JSON Schema $id fields|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\nUsage in CI/CD\nUsing the\nkickstartDS CLI as part of your CI/CD should be pretty straight-forward. If you went the \"Install as a part of a kickstartDS Design System\" route, you only need to make sure to include all the needed environment variables for your build to work (stuff like\nNODE_ENV=production), the rest will be managed by\nnpm.\nIf you installed the\nCLI globally, you'll additionally have to make sure it will be installed in the environment used by your CI/CD when building, too! This can be done by simply adding a line installing it before the actual build command is triggered (like\nyarn global add kickstartds).\nTips, Tricks and Gotchas\nThis section will cover some useful information that should help when working with the\nCLI. It ranges from tips on how to recover from errors to how you can debug a CLI command not running correctly.\nRecover from errors / problems\nIf something failed, or was broken by running a\nCLI command, you can always have a look at the generated temporary folder. All processing will be done in such a temporary folder, only at the end copying the generated result back to your project folder / execution context on success.\nIn case something went horribly wrong, you can always look up that folder to potentially recover your previous state.\nSee the section above about temporary folders for details.\nDebug long running commands\nSome commands might be long running in the future. If it's a specific step, pretty late in the process, that fails, you can consider setting\n--cleanup to\nfalse. This should then pick up your command from the last known state when running again, based on the involved temporary folder.\nThis can be especially useful if that last step only failed because an API wasn't available for a short time frame, or something comparable.\nGetting support\nTo get support, you can always have a look at the issues on our Github repository, or open one yourself if you've stumbled upon something broken or incomprehensible. When doing so, make sure to always include the log output of the command run. Especially the\nkickstartDS CLI version number used, part of that output, is of interest here!\nYou can also join us on Discord. And if that's not your cup of tea, you can reach out to us:\n- Through the chat widget, included in all of our public facing websites\n- By writing us an email\n- By joining us on Twitter\n- By writing us on WhatsApp\nContributing\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as below, without any additional terms or conditions.\nThere's one additional command included with\nkickstartDS CLI, not mentioned before. It's the\ndemo subcommand of the\nexample command, which is just included as a reference to be used when creating new commands. This ensures having the basics in place, and helps you get started way faster!\nReferences\nBuilding a\nCLI with this range of features wouldn't have been possible without a solid foundation to build upon. We'll list our main dependencies here, to give you an idea of the general tooling in use:\n|Dependency||Link||Description|\nInquirer.js |https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/||We use |Inquirer.js to dynamically generate context-sensitive prompts based on the commands JSON Schema.\nCommander.js |https://github.com/tj/commander.js/|Commander.js serves as the foundation for isolated implementation of the different commands, and provides CLI option handling.\nOmelette |https://github.com/f/omelette|Omelette provides auto-complete features and a managed shell integration\nShellJS |https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/||To have consistent behaviour (over |macOS, Linux and Windows) when interacting with shell features inside of commands we use ShellJS.\nwinston |https://github.com/winstonjs/winston||Everything related to logging is handled by |winston. It provides the structure for having multiple transports, writing to the prompt, files, etc.\nChalk |https://github.com/chalk/chalk||Nice colors that work across as many terminals and shells as possible made possible by |Chalk.\nSimple Git |https://github.com/steveukx/git-js||Nice abstraction upon |Git, with a nice API to wrap Git related tasks with.\nNunjucks API |https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html||Mighty and expressive templating engine, we use the |\nNunjucks Templating |https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html||This is the heart of |Nunjucks, used for consistent and efficient templating of all kinds of templates.\nThis can also serve as a great source of inspiration when trying to identify easy to implement extension opportunities for features, commands or options you feel currently missing!", "markdown": "# kickstartDS CLI\n## About\nThe\n**kickstartDS CLI** helps ease everyday tasks when working with Design Systems, especially when building on and with **kickstartDS**.\nIt currently supports two main categories of commands:\nSchema: Generate TypeScripttypes for components, or dereference component JSON Schema Token: Initialize Style Dictionaryusing Branding Token, or build prepared Style Dictionaryplatforms and formats for your token set\nCommands can generally be divided into the following types:\n- Commands that\nthinly wrap other APIs or toolingfor you (for example Style Dictionarycommands within the\ntokenscategory), enabling zero-config use when following our recommended structure for your project\n- Commands\nautomating tasks for you(for example creating TypeScripttypes for your components, or dereferencing them, within the\nschemacategory), which helps keep your project free from scripts for those tasks\n- Commands meant to\nreduce the amount of scaffoldingyou'll have to write manually. We're currently working on those!\nWe generally strive for all the commands to work with zero config when following the project structure outlined in our documentation for your own Design System (it's also the same one used in our starter). But we also try to expose options to change those values as needed, you shouldn't ever\n*need* to follow our structure. If there's an option that's missing for your use case, feel free to contact us so when can add it!\nWe also include support for\n**shell completions**. Though those will probably still need some more intimate knowledge with your terminal and shell setup, they can be a nice addition to explore available commands and options!\n## Installation\nYou'll need to have\n**Node.js** installed to use our **CLI**, see our page about the expected environment when working with **kickstartDS** for details. **kickstartDS CLI** has to be installed for use with **Node.js**, which can be done through all the common package managers. You can either install it globally, or as a dependency of your Design System project.\n##### Install in project\nInstalling the\n**CLI** as part of your Design System projects helps keeping the version used across your team and consumers consistent. We generally advise going this route, and wiring up your local\npackage.json scripts entries to those commands for isolation.\nHave a look at part 2 of our main guide \"Create your Design System\", for a more detailed explanation of this setup.\nAlternatively you can use the\n**CLI** directly, without installing it, by using\nnpx, like this:\n_1npx tokens init\nLearn more about\nnpx as an option to run commands globally, without installation, in the npm Docs.\n### Install globally with\n**npm** or **Yarn**\nkickstartDS CLI is available as a npm package. If you have\n**Node.js** available, you can install it by running:\n_1npm install kickstartds@latest -g\nor if using\n**Yarn**:\n_1yarn global add kickstartds\nIf you're encountering problems with this, or for more details on the technical setup needed to work with\n**kickstartDS**, see our **Getting Started** page about the environment needed.\n### Install as a part of a\n**kickstartDS** Design System\nThis is the preferred way of integrating the\n**kickstartDS CLI** into your workflow. It gives you the ability to fix the version of the **CLI** in use to the exact corresponding **kickstartDS** package versions, added as a dependency to your Design System. It also allows using the **CLI** in multiple projects, without those interferring with each other through a globally installed, shared dependency.\nAll that said: we're being really careful with changes to the\n**CLI**, so it should only ever need to be upgraded when changing to a new breaking release of **kickstartDS** itself. You might still want to upgrade earlier to get access to fixes (\nX.X.3) or new features (\nX.2.X). See our page about\n**Upgrading** to learn more about our release process, and our versioning scheme!\nThe preferred way to install the\n**CLI** to your Design System project would be as a\ndevDependency.\n_1yarn add -D kickstartds\nSee the following code snippet for an example of a typical (abridged) example of a\npackage.json for a Design System project utilizing the\n**kickstartDS CLI**:\nWe have\n@kickstartds/base as our main\n**kickstartDS** package dependency, and\nkickstartds (the\n**kickstartDS CLI**) as a\ndevDependency. We also include\n**React** to complete our\ndependencies, while\nchokidar-cli and\nnpm-run-all help us glue together\n**kickstartDS CLI** commands with our local\nscripts entries, as the remaining\ndevDependencies.\nThere are three integration types at play here: 1. Wire up a\nscript entry to a\n**CLI** command directly (optionally setting parameters as required), 2. Run select\nscripts in parallel (using\nnpm-run-all) to improve DX, by grouping commands commonly used together, and 3. Watch for file changes, to subsequently trigger a\nscript entry... enabling a\nwatch / hot reload mode (using\nchokidar-cli).\nFor a more detailed description of what all those commands do, have a look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\n## Getting started\nOnce you've installed the\n**kickstartDS CLI**, you can verify everything works as expected by running the following command:\n_1kickstartDS --help\nYou'll notice the version of the\n**CLI** used is part of the logs, written by every command you run.

Next up will be pulling the values out from the **Figma** template instance, to transform and write them to your **Design Token** set. **Available options**:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your token dictionary|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\n**JSON Schema** commands\nEvery component based on\n**kickstartDS** includes a **JSON Schema** definition for its component API. Commands in the\nschema category help transform those definitions into other helpful formats like\n**TypeScript** types, or deferenced versions of the schema.\nschema types\nGenerate\n**TypeScript** types for your components, matching your component API / **JSON Schema** exactly. These types can then be used when implementing your **React** template, providing a stable base to rely upon. Generated type definitions are put alongside the **JSON Schema** files, into the components directory.\nYou can set the path components are placed inside your Design System using\n--components-path, if you're not using the directory structure presumed in our guides, examples and starter. You'll always have to provide a domain that is used in your\n**JSON Schema** definitions by specifying\n--schema-domain (e.g.\n--schema-domain schema.mydomain.com).\nSee our component example guide \"Adapt\nButton component\", especially the end of section \"\n**JSON Schema** definition\" and the subsequent section on the \" **React** template\" for an example of this at work. **Available options**:\n|Option||Default||Description|\n|relative path from project root to your components directory|\n|domain used in your JSON Schema $id fields|\nDefault values are in alignment with the main guide, its corresponding repository, and the starter project. Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\nschema dereference\n**JSON Schema** definitions for component APIs can (and often do) include references to other component definitions. This is done by the way of using a\n$ref in one of the properties, or by using advanced workflows involving\nallOf,\nanyOf,\noneOf and so forth.\nBecause we generate\n**Storybook Controls** and documentation for all of the properties of a component (including the referenced ones), we use this command to \"dereference\" all of those keywords. This results in a dereferenced version of the **JSON Schema** with all references resolved and inlined. This can then be used then without involving complex, or computationally expensive, conversions on the client.\nYou can set the path components are placed inside your Design System using\n--components-path, if you're not using the directory structure presumed in our guides, examples and starter.

Which means in those cases, or if just following our best practices, you'll be able to use the subcommand without specifying any special options.\n## Usage in CI/CD\nUsing the\n**kickstartDS CLI** as part of your CI/CD should be pretty straight-forward. If you went the \"Install as a part of a kickstartDS Design System\" route, you only need to make sure to include all the needed environment variables for your build to work (stuff like\nNODE_ENV=production), the rest will be managed by\n**npm**.\nIf you installed the\n**CLI** globally, you'll additionally have to make sure it will be installed in the environment used by your CI/CD when building, too! This can be done by simply adding a line installing it before the actual build command is triggered (like\nyarn global add kickstartds).\n## Tips, Tricks and Gotchas\nThis section will cover some useful information that should help when working with the\n**CLI**. It ranges from tips on how to recover from errors to how you can debug a **CLI** command not running correctly.\n### Recover from errors / problems\nIf something failed, or was broken by running a\n**CLI** command, you can always have a look at the generated temporary folder. All processing will be done in such a temporary folder, only at the end copying the generated result back to your project folder / execution context on success.\nIn case something went horribly wrong, you can always look up that folder to potentially recover your previous state.\nSee the section above about temporary folders for details.\n### Debug long running commands\nSome commands might be long running in the future. If it's a specific step, pretty late in the process, that fails, you can consider setting\n--cleanup to\nfalse. This should then pick up your command from the last known state when running again, based on the involved temporary folder.\nThis can be especially useful if that last step only failed because an API wasn't available for a short time frame, or something comparable.\n## Getting support\nTo get support, you can always have a look at the issues on our Github repository, or open one yourself if you've stumbled upon something broken or incomprehensible. When doing so, make sure to always include the log output of the command run. Especially the\n**kickstartDS CLI** version number used, part of that output, is of interest here!\nYou can also join us on Discord. And if that's not your cup of tea, you can reach out to us:\n- Through the chat widget, included in all of our public facing websites\n- By writing us an email\n- By joining us on Twitter\n- By writing us on WhatsApp\n## Contributing\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as below, without any additional terms or conditions.\nThere's one additional command included with\n**kickstartDS CLI**, not mentioned before. It's the\ndemo subcommand of the\nexample command, which is just included as a reference to be used when creating new commands. This ensures having the basics in place, and helps you get started way faster!\n## References\nBuilding a\n**CLI** with this range of features wouldn't have been possible without a solid foundation to build upon.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/guides/components/extend", "content": {"raw": "Extend a component\nOverview\nExtending a component takes a\nkickstartDS component and expands upon its abilities. But in contrast to customizing a component we don't just add a property, often resulting in changing the markup / template of the involved component in the process. When extending, we add new capabilities to a component by composing it with other components.\nIt involves the same rough steps as adapting a component, but differs from it when it comes to creating the\nReact template. Instead of (only) using the base component directly as imported, and just re-wiring properties, we import and use multiple kickstartDS base components. We also wire our properties into those used different components as needed.\nCustomizing vs Extending\nIn both processes we add new features to a component, which results in it fitting one of the use cases we have in mind for our Design System.\nIn the case of customizing a component, we either change the way a property of an existing\nkickstartDS base component behaves, or we add a new property to it altogether. But it's always a change that results in customizing the React component template, too. For example: adding a\nswitchOrder property to the\nHeadline.\nWhen extending a component, we take one existing\nkickstartDS base component and compose it with other kickstartDS base components to gain new functionality. We don't change the React component template in the process. For example: adding call-to-actions to our\nSection.\nBoth processes can be combined in a component, if needed!\nThis can also be part of creating a component, (see our\nTeaserCard component example for that). Or be used while customizing a component that expands on some\nkickstartDS base component (see our\nSection component example for that).\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\nkickstartDS, have a look at the overview page of this section.\nExtension process\nAs with the adaptation process, the big assumption here is that you already have a\nkickstartDS base component in mind. But unlike in that one, we have some requirement or feature that is not covered by it. We almost have a match. Additionally, the change required involves adding other kickstartDS base components into the mix... not changing the involved components themselves. That would be covered by the customization process.\nFinding your component definition is still very simplified, we just have to add those properties not covered by the base component into the mix ourselves.\nAdaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\nkickstartDS components, when used as a base component. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nIf you don't have a\nkickstartDS base component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in customizing a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's get started!\n1. Component definition\nThe extension process starts by defining a component API. As with the adaptation process this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component. But this time, we'll also add a requirement that's not covered by the base component.\nWe'll use the\nSection component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Extend\nSection component\".\nAs our additional requirement, we'll want to be able to add some call-to-actions at the end of a section. That's not something the base\nSection can do, so we'll add this ourselves.\nPurpose\nThere's not a lot different here when compared to the adaptation process. We just mainly keep close to the original purpose of our chosen\nkickstartDS base component.\nThere should be an exception though, as we have a requirement on our mind that is not part of the component yet. This will probably be part of the purpose of our component.\nFor our\nSection example, this could mean adding more places of putting call-to-actions being that requirement. Adding it to the\nSection allows adding one between every section of our website, which should be plenty! Using the\nButton as a component for those call-to-actions allows for re-use there, too.\nStructure\nWe'll also still start by defining a rough draft of our component API here.\nLet's keep going with our\nSection component as an example. We're starting with the following properties:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Width of section to use|\n|Size of gutter to use|\n|Layout mode used for section contents|\n|Allowed content for the section|\n|Type of background|\n|Whether to invert the section|\n|Amount of spacing before the section|\n|Amount of spacing after the section|\n|Headline|\n|Additional Class|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nSection in our\nStorybook here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-section--content-boxes\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Extend\nSection component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Headline for the section|\n|Width of section to use|\n|Size of gutter to use|\n|Layout mode used for section contents|\n|Allowed content for the section|\n|Style of section, influences background|\n|Amount of spacing before the section|\n|Amount of spacing after the section|\n|Whether to invert the section|\n|Call-to-actions to show|\n|Label for the Call to action|\n|Target for the Call to action|\nWe took\nwidth,\ngutter,\nmode,\ncontent,\nspaceBefore,\nspaceAfter and\ninverted directly, and renamed\nbackground to\nstyle for our version of the\nSection. And crucially we add our own property\nctas into the mix. We also reduce the complexity of\nheadline significantly... from mapping to all of the\nHeadline properties, to just a single\nstring type prop setting its content. Required fields are marked with a\n*.\n2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\nJSON Schema, and create a React template matching our selected properties to the kickstartDS base component. While creating that template, we'll also import additional components and mix them with our original kickstartDS base component to implement our new requirements.\nJSON Schema definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\nJSON Schema for them, defining their component API in code. Like with customization we add our own, new property into the mix.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nSection again (adding our own\nctas property):\nOriginal\nSection\nThis is the \"full\" section component API /\nJSON Schema. We've just reduced the property definitions.\nSelect from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\nCreate your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\nJSON Schema...\nRenaming props\n... and rename props in the process.\nAdd our new prop\nMost importantly, we add our new property.\nFinished component\nJSON Schema\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\nExtending multiple properties\nThis process can also involve extending a component by adding multiple properties to it. Just repeat all the steps for every property you'll need to add.\nIn general: these guides are mainly meant as basic building blocks, that can be combined and remixed by you to create exactly what you need... even if that's something more complex than described in these basic guides here.\nFor the full version of customizing a\nSection have a look at our \"Extend\nSection component\" guide.\nReact template\nNow that our\nJSON Schema is defined, we'll automatically get matching TypeScript types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the kickstartDS base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and TypeScript telling us about required properties in the base component, this is gets easy like squeezing a lemon!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nSection, creating the component template:\nNecessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\nkickstartDS base component\nSection, our own\nButton component, and our own components\nTypeScript types.\nWe use our own\nButton here, with the assumption that that already got adapted by us. See the \"Adapt\nButton component\" guide to see how this could look like. But we could just as well have imported another (or even multiple other)\nkickstartDS base component(s) here.\nAdd correct type to component\nWe need to type our\nReact component to use our JSON Schema, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly. For the\nSection this means including\nHTMLAttributes, as it maps to a\n under the hood.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nUnlike when directly adapting or creating a\n**kickstartDS** base component, we don't just use one base component. We recombine several different base components into a version that fits our needs instead.\nAnd unlike customizing, we don't change any\n**kickstartDS** base components underlying markup.\n##### Destructure additional props\nWe start with the\nprops we're carrying through first. This ensures properties defined in our component API will always take precedence, because they're added after the general\nprops.\n##### Combining base components 1/5\nThis is where we actually extend the original components scope.\nWe apply a small trick here: if there are\nctas defined, we'll just add a second section to the output.\n##### Combining base components 2/5\nInside that second section, we render all the call-to-actions given to us as\nButtons. We choose the variant rendered according to its index (first =\nprimary, etc) in the list.\n##### Combining base components 3/5\nWhen there are call-to-actions, we also ensure the sections share the same visual style...\n##### Combining base components 4/5\n... and reduce the spacing between them to make everything feel seamless!\n##### Combining base components 5/5\nThe rest of the components gets wired up as usual.\n##### Adding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\n**React** component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted an existing\n**kickstartDS** base component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes that base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nSection component by default. For example we might have our own\nPage component, based on the\n**kickstartDS**\nPage which includes a\nSection.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our customized\nSection actually gets used, you can just change the default\nSection rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\n**React Context** in our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\n##### Visual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\n**React** components that include **TypeScript** types... like **kickstartDS** components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\n## Technical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds minimal technical debt to your Design System. Not much has been changed around, we just add a small layer on top of the original\n**kickstartDS** base component(s).\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- removal of the base component(s)\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the components template (both\nReact, and the resulting HTML)\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\n**React** template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version.

But in contrast to customizing a component we don't just add a property, often resulting in changing the markup / template of the involved component in the process. When extending, we add new capabilities to a component by composing it with other components.\nIt involves the same rough steps as adapting a component, but differs from it when it comes to creating the\n**React** template. Instead of (only) using the base component directly as imported, and just re-wiring properties, we import and use multiple **kickstartDS** base components. We also wire our properties into those used different components as needed.\n##### Customizing vs Extending\nIn both processes we add new features to a component, which results in it fitting one of the use cases we have in mind for our Design System.\nIn the case of customizing a component, we either change the way a property of an existing\n**kickstartDS** base component behaves, or we add a new property to it altogether. But it's always a change that results in customizing the **React** component template, too. For example: adding a\nswitchOrder property to the\nHeadline.\nWhen extending a component, we take one existing\n**kickstartDS** base component and compose it with other **kickstartDS** base components to gain new functionality. We don't change the **React** component template in the process. For example: adding call-to-actions to our\nSection.\nBoth processes can be combined in a component, if needed!\nThis can also be part of creating a component, (see our\nTeaserCard component example for that). Or be used while customizing a component that expands on some\n**kickstartDS** base component (see our\nSection component example for that).\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\n**kickstartDS**, have a look at the overview page of this section.\n## Extension process\nAs with the adaptation process, the big assumption here is that you already have a\n**kickstartDS** base component in mind. But unlike in that one, we have some requirement or feature that is not covered by it. We *almost* have a match. Additionally, the change required involves adding other **kickstartDS** base components into the mix... not changing the involved components themselves. That would be covered by the customization process.\nFinding your component definition is still very simplified, we just have to add those properties not covered by the base component into the mix ourselves.\n##### Adaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\n**kickstartDS** components, when used as a base component. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nIf you don't have a\n**kickstartDS** base component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in customizing a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's get started!\n### 1. Component definition\nThe extension process starts by defining a component API. As with the adaptation process this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component. But this time, we'll also add a requirement that's not covered by the base component.\nWe'll use the\nSection component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Extend\nSection component\".\nAs our additional requirement, we'll want to be able to add some call-to-actions at the end of a section. That's not something the base\nSection can do, so we'll add this ourselves.\n#### Purpose\nThere's not a lot different here when compared to the adaptation process. We just mainly keep close to the original purpose of our chosen\n**kickstartDS** base component.\nThere should be an exception though, as we have a requirement on our mind that is not part of the component yet. This will probably be part of the purpose of our component.\nFor our\nSection example, this could mean adding more places of putting call-to-actions being that requirement. Adding it to the\nSection allows adding one between every section of our website, which should be plenty! Using the\nButton as a component for those call-to-actions allows for re-use there, too.\n#### Structure\nWe'll also still start by defining a rough draft of our component API here.\nLet's keep going with our\nSection component as an example. We're starting with the following properties:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Width of section to use|\n|Size of gutter to use|\n|Layout mode used for section contents|\n|Allowed content for the section|\n|Type of background|\n|Whether to invert the section|\n|Amount of spacing before the section|\n|Amount of spacing after the section|\n|Headline|\n|Additional Class|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nSection in our\n**Storybook** here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-section--content-boxes\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Extend\nSection component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Headline for the section|\n|Width of section to use|\n|Size of gutter to use|\n|Layout mode used for section contents|\n|Allowed content for the section|\n|Style of section, influences background|\n|Amount of spacing before the section|\n|Amount of spacing after the section|\n|Whether to invert the section|\n|Call-to-actions to show|\n|Label for the Call to action|\n|Target for the Call to action|\nWe took\nwidth,\ngutter,\nmode,\ncontent,\nspaceBefore,\nspaceAfter and\ninverted directly, and renamed\nbackground to\nstyle for our version of the\nSection. And crucially we add our own property\nctas into the mix. We also reduce the complexity of\nheadline significantly... from mapping to all of the\nHeadline properties, to just a single\nstring type prop setting its content. Required fields are marked with a\n*.\n### 2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\n**JSON Schema**, and create a **React** template matching our selected properties to the **kickstartDS** base component. While creating that template, we'll also import additional components and mix them with our original **kickstartDS** base component to implement our new requirements.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\n**JSON Schema** for them, defining their component API in code. Like with customization we add our own, new property into the mix.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nSection again (adding our own\nctas property):\n#### Original\nSection\nThis is the \"full\" section component API /\n**JSON Schema**. We've just reduced the property definitions.\n#### Select from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\n#### Create your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\n**JSON Schema**...\n#### Renaming props\n... and rename props in the process.\n#### Add our new prop\nMost importantly, we add our new property.\n#### Finished component\n**JSON Schema**\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\n##### Extending multiple properties\nThis process can also involve extending a component by adding multiple properties to it. Just repeat all the steps for every property you'll need to add.\nIn general: these guides are mainly meant as basic building blocks, that can be combined and remixed by you to create exactly what you need... even if that's something more complex than described in these basic guides here.\nFor the full version of customizing a\nSection have a look at our \"Extend\nSection component\" guide.\n**React** template\nNow that our\n**JSON Schema** is defined, we'll automatically get matching **TypeScript** types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the **kickstartDS** base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and **TypeScript** telling us about required properties in the base component, this is gets easy like squeezing a lemon!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nSection, creating the component template:\n##### Necessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\n**kickstartDS** base component\nSection, our own\nButton component, and our own components\n**TypeScript** types.\nWe use our own\nButton here, with the assumption that that already got adapted by us. See the \"Adapt\nButton component\" guide to see how this could look like. But we could just as well have imported another (or even multiple other)\n**kickstartDS** base component(s) here.\n##### Add correct type to component\nWe need to type our\n**React** component to use our **JSON Schema**, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly. For the\nSection this means including\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, as it maps to a\n<div> under the hood.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nUnlike when directly adapting or creating a\n**kickstartDS** base component, we don't just use one base component. We recombine several different base components into a version that fits our needs instead.\nAnd unlike customizing, we don't change any\n**kickstartDS** base components underlying markup.\n##### Destructure additional props\nWe start with the\nprops we're carrying through first. This ensures properties defined in our component API will always take precedence, because they're added after the general\nprops.\n##### Combining base components 1/5\nThis is where we actually extend the original components scope.\nWe apply a small trick here: if there are\nctas defined, we'll just add a second section to the output.\n##### Combining base components 2/5\nInside that second section, we render all the call-to-actions given to us as\nButtons. We choose the variant rendered according to its index (first =\nprimary, etc) in the list.\n##### Combining base components 3/5\nWhen there are call-to-actions, we also ensure the sections share the same visual style...\n##### Combining base components 4/5\n... and reduce the spacing between them to make everything feel seamless!\n##### Combining base components 5/5\nThe rest of the components gets wired up as usual.\n##### Adding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\n**React** component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted an existing\n**kickstartDS** base component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes that base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nSection component by default. For example we might have our own\nPage component, based on the\n**kickstartDS**\nPage which includes a\nSection.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our customized\nSection actually gets used, you can just change the default\nSection rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\n**React Context** in our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\n##### Visual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\n**React** components that include **TypeScript** types... like **kickstartDS** components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\n## Technical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds minimal technical debt to your Design System. Not much has been changed around, we just add a small layer on top of the original\n**kickstartDS** base component(s).\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- removal of the base component(s)\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the components template (both\nReact, and the resulting HTML)\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\n**React** template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version. Finally a removed field you're actually using would mean adding additional customization to regain that functionality. Have a look at our\nHeadline example guide to see how you'd add your own, new property!\nLearn more about what we mean by technical debt here on the overview page of this section.\n## Examples\nWe continuously expand our component example guides, below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.\n### Extend\nSection component\nIn this example component guide we extend the\nSection component (as part of the\n@kickstartDS/base module) to use it for sections in our own Design System.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/guides/components/adapt", "content": {"raw": "Adapt a component\nOverview\nAdapting a component means to use the component \"directly\". This includes using the same name and purpose for it. The obvious example would be using the\nButton provided by\nkickstartDS for the\nButton as part of your own Design System. It typically doesn't make a lot of sense to find a different name for this component, because the name is fitting and well-known.\nthe process of changing to suit different conditions\nThe word \"directly\" above is set in quotes, because even though we re-use the component with the same intent, we will still want to reduce the offered options (component properties) to better suit our needs. A simple component API helps in creating a shared understanding of what a component is, and does.\nkickstartDS component properties\nComponents as delivered by\nkickstartDS modules (like\n@kickstartDS/base for the\nButton) have to support a wide range of use cases, as they get used to build a multitude of different, but custom,\nButton implementations in the end.\nThis means reducing the set of properties, given by the component API of a\nkickstartDS component, to your needs is explicitly something that should be done! You still benefit by the broad, underlying foundation giving you flexibility when further adapting your own version of it. For example when adding a variant including an\nIcon, which was not part of your\nButton before.\nFor a detailed example of adapting the\nButton component, have a look at our component example guide describing just that!\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\nkickstartDS, have a look at the overview page of this section.\nAdaptation process\nThere's one big assumption made when choosing the adaptation process: you've already identified a component you'd like to use... and it already offers all the options you'll need. Let's call this component the base component.\nThis greatly simplifies finding a component definition, as it means simply selecting props you'd like to use for yourself, from a well-defined set.\nAdaptation process as a base line\nEach of the other ways of adding a component to your Design System based on\nkickstartDS builds upon this adapdation process.\nWhich is to say, you'll always want to reduce the props of\nkickstartDS components used as a base, as described here. But sometimes that may not be enough. You might need a slightly different version of the component, or its props (learn more in our guide \"Customize a component\", or view \"Customize\nHeadline component\" as an example), or you may want to add something completely new to it (learn more in our guide \"Extend a component\", or view \"Extend\nSection component\" as an example).\nIf you don't have component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in adapting a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's see what they're all about!\n1. Component Definition\nThe adaptation process starts by defining a component API. As touched on before, this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component.\nWe'll use the\nButton component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\".\nPurpose\nFor the adaptation process the main purpose of a component is already defined by the selected base component. Nontheless, the purpose for even a well-known type of component, like the\nButton, can vary from one Design System to the next. So it helps to think about the specific purpose the selected base component will serve in\nyour Design System.\nAs a hypothetical: you might decide to\nreally only use components looking like a\nButton for elements the user directly interacts with... but not for links. This would be a big part of the components purpose, and thus should inform your property selection and naming process.\nStructure\nBefore we start implementing, we'll want to define a first rough draft of our component API. Defining a name, a small description and a rough type, per property, goes a long way in keeping the focus on the core of your component.\nLet's keep using the\nButton as an example. We're starting with the following properties with that one:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text used on button|\n|Choose one of the styles from the list|\n|If the button should be inverted|\n|Choose a size between small, medium and large|\n|Link used for button|\n|Icon identifier for icon before the button text|\n|Icon identifier for icon after the button text|\n|Add fill animation on hover|\n|Add icon animation on hover|\n|Select the type attribute for the button|\n|Define a value attribute for the button|\n|Define a name attribute for the button|\n|Set the disabled attribute for the button|\n|Open link in new Tab|\n|Add additional css classes that should be applied to the button|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n.\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nButton in our\nStorybook* here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-button--solid\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text content to display inside the button|\n|Target that should be linked, makes the button behave like a link semantically when set|\n|Variant of button to be used|\n|Size of button to use|\n|Whether the button should be disabled|\nWe took\nlabel,\nvariant,\nsize and\ndisabled directly, and renamed\nhref to\ntarget for our version of the\nButton. Required fields are marked with a\n* again.\nIn our hypothetical above, we would probably drop the option of specifying\nhref or\ntarget altogether.\n2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\nJSON Schema, and create a React template matching our selected properties to the kickstartDS base component.\nJSON Schema definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\nJSON Schema for them, defining their component API in code.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nButton again:\nOriginal\nButton\nThis is the \"full\" button component API /\nJSON Schema. We've just reduced the property definitions.\nSelect from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\nCreate your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\nJSON Schema...\nRenaming props\n... and we can even rename props in the process.\nAdd\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\nFinished component\nJSON Schema\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\nFor the full version of adapting a\nButton have a look at our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\".\nReact template\nNow that our\nJSON Schema is defined, we'll automatically get matching TypeScript types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the kickstartDS base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and TypeScript telling us about required properties in the base component, this is done in light speed!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nButton, creating the component template:\nNecessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\nkickstartDS base component and our own components TypeScript types.\nAdd correct type to component\nWe need to type our\nReact component to use our JSON Schema, while also making sure native HTML attributes and React refs are passed correctly. For the\nButton this means also including\nHTMLAnchorElement | HTMLButtonElement and using\nforwardRef.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\nAdd parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\nAnd in the case of the\nButton, we also have to add the\nref added through\nforwardRef.\nDestructure additional props\nComing to our component JSX, we start by passing down (destructuring) the\nprops we're carrying through first. This ensures properties defined in our component API will always take precedence, because they're added after the general\nprops.\nGlue component API to base component 1/3\nThe simplest cases of connecting props to the base component is when the name of the property is taken from the base component. We can just directly pass those without much thought.\nGlue component API to base component 2/3\nIn some cases we might have changed the name of a prop. In that instance, we just to have to wire up the renamed property to the originally named base components property.\nGlue component API to base component 3/3\nFinally there might be properties where the naming of the actual values was changed, for example when adapting\nenum typed properties.\nWe'll have to simply rewire the values in that case.\nFinalize component JSX by adding the\nref\nThis will be optional, and depend on the element being handled. If you've included a\nforwardRef before, you'll have to pass that\nref down to the\nkickstartDS base component.\nWe'll have to simply rewire the values in that case.\nAdding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\nReact component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted a component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes the base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nButton component by default. For example we might have our own\nTeaserCard component, based on the\nkickstartDS\nTeaserBox which includes a\nButton.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our\nButton actually gets used, you can just change the default\nButton rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\nReact Context in[our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\nVisual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\nReact components that include TypeScript types... like kickstartDS components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\nTechnical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds minimal technical debt to your Design System. Not much has been changed around, we just add a small layer on top of the original\nkickstartDS base component.\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- removal of the base component\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the components template (both\nReact, and the resulting HTML)\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\nReact template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version. Finally a removed field you're actually using would mean adding additional customization to regain that functionality. Have a look at our\nHeadline example guide to see how you'd add your own, new property!\nLearn more about what we mean by technical debt here on the overview page of this section.\nExamples\nWe continuously expand our component example guides, below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.\nAdapt\nButton component\nIn this example component guide we adapt the\nButton component (as part of the\n@kickstartDS/base module) to use it for buttons in our own Design System. We drastically reduce the options used, and offered, in our own adaptation. We remove all options that include having an\nIcon displayed as part of the\nButton, for example.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n_1", "markdown": "# Adapt a component\n## Overview\nAdapting a component means to use the component \"directly\". This includes using the same name and purpose for it. The obvious example would be using the\nButton provided by\n**kickstartDS** for the\nButton as part of your own Design System. It typically doesn't make a lot of sense to find a different name for this component, because the name is fitting and well-known.\nthe process of changing to suit different conditions\nThe word \"directly\" above is set in quotes, because even though we re-use the component with the same intent, we will still want to reduce the offered options (component properties) to better suit our needs. A simple component API helps in creating a shared understanding of what a component is, and does.\n##### kickstartDS component properties\nComponents as delivered by\n**kickstartDS** modules (like\n@kickstartDS/base for the\nButton) have to support a wide range of use cases, as they get used to build a multitude of different, but custom,\nButton implementations in the end.\nThis means reducing the set of properties, given by the component API of a\n**kickstartDS** component, to your needs is explicitly something that should be done! You still benefit by the broad, underlying foundation giving you flexibility when further adapting your own version of it. For example when adding a variant including an\nIcon, which was not part of your\nButton before.\nFor a detailed example of adapting the\nButton component, have a look at our component example guide describing just that!\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\n**kickstartDS**, have a look at the overview page of this section.\n## Adaptation process\nThere's one big assumption made when choosing the adaptation process: you've already identified a component you'd like to use... and it already offers all the options you'll need. Let's call this component the base component.\nThis greatly simplifies finding a component definition, as it means simply selecting props you'd like to use for yourself, from a well-defined set.\n##### Adaptation process as a base line\nEach of the other ways of adding a component to your Design System based on\n**kickstartDS** builds upon this adapdation process.\nWhich is to say, you'll always want to reduce the props of\n**kickstartDS** components used as a base, as described here. But sometimes that may not be enough. You might need a slightly different version of the component, or its props (learn more in our guide \"Customize a component\", or view \"Customize\nHeadline component\" as an example), or you may want to add something completely new to it (learn more in our guide \"Extend a component\", or view \"Extend\nSection component\" as an example).\nIf you don't have component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in adapting a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's see what they're all about!\n### 1. Component Definition\nThe adaptation process starts by defining a component API. As touched on before, this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component.\nWe'll use the\nButton component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\".\n#### Purpose\nFor the adaptation process the main purpose of a component is already defined by the selected base component. Nontheless, the purpose for even a well-known type of component, like the\nButton, can vary from one Design System to the next. So it helps to think about the specific purpose the selected base component will serve in\n**your** Design System.\nAs a hypothetical: you might decide to\n**really** only use components looking like a\nButton for elements the user directly interacts with... but not for links. This would be a big part of the components purpose, and thus should inform your property selection and naming process.\n#### Structure\nBefore we start implementing, we'll want to define a first rough draft of our component API. Defining a name, a small description and a rough type, per property, goes a long way in keeping the focus on the core of your component.\nLet's keep using the\nButton as an example. We're starting with the following properties with that one:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text used on button|\n|Choose one of the styles from the list|\n|If the button should be inverted|\n|Choose a size between small, medium and large|\n|Link used for button|\n|Icon identifier for icon before the button text|\n|Icon identifier for icon after the button text|\n|Add fill animation on hover|\n|Add icon animation on hover|\n|Select the type attribute for the button|\n|Define a value attribute for the button|\n|Define a name attribute for the button|\n|Set the disabled attribute for the button|\n|Open link in new Tab|\n|Add additional css classes that should be applied to the button|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nButton in our\n**Storybook** here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-button--solid\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text content to display inside the button|\n|Target that should be linked, makes the button behave like a link semantically when set|\n|Variant of button to be used|\n|Size of button to use|\n|Whether the button should be disabled|\nWe took\nlabel,\nvariant,\nsize and\ndisabled directly, and renamed\nhref to\ntarget for our version of the\nButton. Required fields are marked with a\n* again.\nIn our hypothetical above, we would probably drop the option of specifying\nhref or\ntarget altogether.\n### 2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\n**JSON Schema**, and create a **React** template matching our selected properties to the **kickstartDS** base component.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\n**JSON Schema** for them, defining their component API in code.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nButton again:\n#### Original\nButton\nThis is the \"full\" button component API /\n**JSON Schema**. We've just reduced the property definitions.\n#### Select from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\n#### Create your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\n**JSON Schema**...\n#### Renaming props\n... and we can even rename props in the process.\n#### Add\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\n#### Finished component\n**JSON Schema**\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\nFor the full version of adapting a\nButton have a look at our guide \"Adapt\nButton component\".\n**React** template\nNow that our\n**JSON Schema** is defined, we'll automatically get matching **TypeScript** types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the **kickstartDS** base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and **TypeScript** telling us about required properties in the base component, this is done in light speed!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nButton, creating the component template:\n##### Necessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\n**kickstartDS** base component and our own components **TypeScript** types.\n##### Add correct type to component\nWe need to type our\n**React** component to use our **JSON Schema**, while also making sure native HTML attributes and **React** refs are passed correctly.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/guides/components/customize", "content": {"raw": "Customize a component\nOverview\nCustomizing a component should be part of your arsenal if you already have a specific\nkickstartDS component in mind, but it's missing a certain feature that you require. Instead of starting from zero, you can always just customize existing base components for your own purposes.\nIt involves the same rough steps as adapting a component, but differs from it when it comes to creating the\nReact template. Instead of (only) using the base component directly as imported, and just re-wiring properties, we customize the markup the base component uses to include our own behaviour. Everything else will basically be the same.\nCustomizing vs Extending\nIn both processes we add new features to a component, which results in it fitting one of the use cases we have in mind for our Design System.\nIn the case of customizing a component, we either change the way a property of an existing\nkickstartDS base component behaves, or we add a new property to it altogether. But it's always a change that results in customizing the React component template, too. For example: adding a\nswitchOrder property to the\nHeadline.\nWhen extending a component, we take one existing\nkickstartDS base component and compose it with other kickstartDS base components to gain new functionality. We don't change the React component template in the process. For example: adding call-to-actions to our\nSection.\nBoth processes can be combined in a component, if needed!\nAdditionally this can of course also be used while creating a component, (see our\nTeaserCard component example for that). Or be used while extending a component that expands on some\nkickstartDS base component (see our\nSection component example for that).\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\nkickstartDS, have a look at the overview page of this section.\nCustomization process\nAs with the adaptation process, the big assumption here is that you already have a\nkickstartDS base component in mind. But unlike in that one, we have some requirement or feature that is not covered by it. We almost have a match. Additionally, the change required involves changing the component itself... not adding other kickstartDS base components into the mix. That would be covered by the extension process, instead.\nFinding your component definition is still very simplified, we just have to add those properties not covered by the base component into the mix ourselves.\nAdaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\nkickstartDS components, when used as a base component. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nIf you don't have a\nkickstartDS base component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in customizing a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's get right to it!\n1. Component Definition\nThe customizing process starts by defining a component API. As with the adaptation process this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component. But this time, we'll also add a requirement that's not covered by the base component.\nWe'll use the\nHeadline component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Customize\nHeadline component\".\nAs our additional requirement, we'll want to be able to switch the order of the main und sub headlines. That's not something the base\nHeadline can do, so we'll add this ourselves. We also want to be able to render some light RTE-like markup in our headline and subheadline, to emphasize something with by making it bold for example.\nPurpose\nThere's not a lot different here when compared to the adaptation process. We just mainly keep close to the original purpose of our chosen\nkickstartDS base component.\nThere should be an exception though, as we have a requirement on our mind that is not part of the component yet. This will probably be part of the purpose of our component.\nFor our\nHeadline example, this could mean adding more flexibility being that requirement. We might want our component to fit more use cases, by switching said order in specific circumstances, and allowing additional code formatting for its content.\nStructure\nWe'll also still start by defining a rough draft of our component API here.\nLet's keep going with our\nHeadline component as an example. We're starting with the following properties:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Select the headline level to use, or p alternatively|\n|Select the headline style to use|\n|Choose an alignment for the headline|\n|Text content for the headline|\n|Text content for the optional subheadline|\n|Add additional spacing to the bottom of the headline|\n|Additional Classes|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n.\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nHeadline in our\nStorybook* here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-headline--h-1\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Customize\nHeadline component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text content of headline|\n|Subheadline content|\n|Switch order of headline and subheadline|\n|Level of headline to use|\n|Style of headline to show|\n|Whether to display space after headline|\nWe took\nlevel and\nspaceAfter directly, and renamed\nsubheadline to\nsub,\nstyleAs to\nstyle and\ncontent to\ntext for our version of the\nHeadline. And crucially we add our own property\nswitchOrder into the mix. Required fields are marked with a\n* again.\n2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\nJSON Schema, and create a React template matching our selected properties to the kickstartDS base component. While creating that template, we'll add the markup changes necessary to fit our additional requirement into the component.\nJSON Schema definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\nJSON Schema for them, defining their component API in code. This time we add our own, new property into the mix.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nHeadline again (adding our own\nswitchOrder property):\nOriginal\nHeadline\nThis is the \"full\" headline component API /\nJSON Schema. We've just reduced the property definitions.\nSelect from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\nCreate your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\nJSON Schema...\nRenaming props\n... and rename props in the process.\nAdd our new prop\nMost importantly, we add our new property.\nAdd\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\nFinished component\nJSON Schema\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\nCustomizing multiple properties\nThis process can also involve customizing a component by adding multiple properties to it. Just repeat all the steps for every property you'll need to add.\nIn general: these guides are mainly meant as basic building blocks, that can be combined and remixed by you to create exactly what you need... even if that's something more complex than described in these basic guides here.\nFor the full version of customizing a\nHeadline have a look at our \"Customize\nHeadline component\" guide.\nReact template\nNow that our\nJSON Schema is defined, we'll automatically get matching TypeScript types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the kickstartDS base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and TypeScript telling us about required properties in the base component, this is gets easy like squeezing a lemon!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nHeadline, creating the component template:\nNecessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\nkickstartDS base component, a rendering function being capable of rendering Markdown and our own components TypeScript types.\nUnlike the adapt, create and extend processes we don't actually need the\nHeadlineContextDefault, because we'll add our own markup... based on the original\nkickstartDS base components markup.\nDefining\nRenderFunctions\nWe define the render functions interface that will enable our RTE-like functionality for the\ntext and\nsub properties.\nAdd correct type to component\nWe need to type our\nReact component to use our JSON Schema, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly and our render functions are understood. For the\nHeadline this means including\nHTMLAttributes, as it maps to a\n under the hood, and our\nRenderFunctions interface.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\nAnd in the case of the\nHeadline, we also include our rendering functions.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nUnlike when directly adapting or extending a\n**kickstartDS** base component, we can't use some imported component directly. We need to reference the template of the original component we're customizing, to copy the parts that need customizing.\nFor the\nHeadline this means copying and customizing this template.\n##### Destructure additional props\nWe start with the\nprops we're carrying through first. We add those to the root\n element, like in the original component.\n##### Adjustments to copied template markup 1/3\nThis is where we actually customize the original components markup.\nFor the\nHeadline we drop properties we don't use (e.g.\nclassName), add hard coded values for others required but not part of our component API (e.g.\nalign) and rename the ones we've given another name to (e.g.\nstyleAs vs\nstyle)\n##### Adjustments to copied template markup 2/3\nThe real custommization lies in adding the\nsubheadline /\nsub in two places, before\n**and** after the main headline content. We just add matching\nif clauses using\nswitchOrder and\n!switchOrder respectively, to toggle the one being displayed.\n##### Adjustments to copied template markup 3/3\nWe also ensure adding our rendering functions to headline content and subheadline.\n##### Adding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\n**React** component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted an existing\n**kickstartDS** base component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes that base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nHeadline component by default. For example we might have our own\nTeaserCard component, based on the\n**kickstartDS**\nTeaserBox which includes a\nHeadline.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our customized\nHeadline actually gets used, you can just change the default\nHeadline rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\n**React Context** in our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\n##### Visual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\n**React** components that include **TypeScript** types... like **kickstartDS** components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\n## Technical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds a bit more technical debt than, for example, directly adapting or creating a component. Even extending a component can potentially carry less technical debt, if the extended component is mainly composed of unchanged\n**kickstartDS** base components. We still only add a small layer on top of the original **kickstartDS** base component from a component API perspective, but we **also** customize the markup.\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- changes to the base components\nReacttemplate\n- removal of the base components\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\n**React** template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version. Finally a removed field you're actually using would mean adding additional customization to regain that functionality. Have a look at our\nHeadline example guide to see how you'd add your own, new property!\nChanges to the markup of a components\n**React** component will also need to be adapted. Those will always be Breaking Changes, though. And there'll always be a migration guide detailing the changes you'll have to follow. But it's still one crucial dependency added for you to worry about.\n##### Immunity to underlying design and layout changes\nHow immune you are to changes to design and layout of a\n**kickstartDS** base component can depend on the changes you've made to the component while customizing. If you're closely adhering to the original **CSS** / **SCSS** BEM class structure, only hard coding some classes in your copied template, you should be safe.\nLearn more about what we mean by technical debt here on the overview page of this section.\n## Examples\nWe continuously expand our component example guides, below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.\n### Customize\nHeadline component\nIn this example component guide we customize the\nHeadline component (as part of the\n@kickstartDS/base module) to use it for headlines in our own Design System. We greatly simplify the\nHeadline and add both our own\nswitchOrder property and RTE-like rendering capabilities for text content.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n_1", "markdown": "# Customize a component\n## Overview\nCustomizing a component should be part of your arsenal if you already have a specific\n**kickstartDS** component in mind, but it's missing a certain feature that you require. Instead of starting from zero, you can always just customize existing base components for your own purposes.\nIt involves the same rough steps as adapting a component, but differs from it when it comes to creating the\n**React** template. Instead of (only) using the base component directly as imported, and just re-wiring properties, we customize the markup the base component uses to include our own behaviour. Everything else will basically be the same.\n##### Customizing vs Extending\nIn both processes we add new features to a component, which results in it fitting one of the use cases we have in mind for our Design System.\nIn the case of customizing a component, we either change the way a property of an existing\n**kickstartDS** base component behaves, or we add a new property to it altogether. But it's always a change that results in customizing the **React** component template, too. For example: adding a\nswitchOrder property to the\nHeadline.\nWhen extending a component, we take one existing\n**kickstartDS** base component and compose it with other **kickstartDS** base components to gain new functionality. We don't change the **React** component template in the process. For example: adding call-to-actions to our\nSection.\nBoth processes can be combined in a component, if needed!\nAdditionally this can of course also be used while creating a component, (see our\nTeaserCard component example for that). Or be used while extending a component that expands on some\n**kickstartDS** base component (see our\nSection component example for that).\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\n**kickstartDS**, have a look at the overview page of this section.\n## Customization process\nAs with the adaptation process, the big assumption here is that you already have a\n**kickstartDS** base component in mind. But unlike in that one, we have some requirement or feature that is not covered by it. We *almost* have a match. Additionally, the change required involves changing the component itself... not adding other **kickstartDS** base components into the mix. That would be covered by the extension process, instead.\nFinding your component definition is still very simplified, we just have to add those properties not covered by the base component into the mix ourselves.\n##### Adaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\n**kickstartDS** components, when used as a base component. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nIf you don't have a\n**kickstartDS** base component in mind yet, you're probably better served by our guide \"Create a component\". In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.\nWe also have an example for this with \"Create\nTeaser Card component\".\nIf you're still unsure, then maybe you're still missing a clear picture on what your components should look like. In that case, you should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nThere are two main steps in customizing a component:\n- Component definition, and\n- Component creation\nLet's get right to it!\n### 1. Component Definition\nThe customizing process starts by defining a component API. As with the adaptation process this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component. But this time, we'll also add a requirement that's not covered by the base component.\nWe'll use the\nHeadline component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Customize\nHeadline component\".\nAs our additional requirement, we'll want to be able to switch the order of the main und sub headlines. That's not something the base\nHeadline can do, so we'll add this ourselves. We also want to be able to render some light RTE-like markup in our headline and subheadline, to emphasize something with by making it bold for example.\n#### Purpose\nThere's not a lot different here when compared to the adaptation process. We just mainly keep close to the original purpose of our chosen\n**kickstartDS** base component.\nThere should be an exception though, as we have a requirement on our mind that is not part of the component yet. This will probably be part of the purpose of our component.\nFor our\nHeadline example, this could mean adding more flexibility being that requirement. We might want our component to fit more use cases, by switching said order in specific circumstances, and allowing additional code formatting for its content.\n#### Structure\nWe'll also still start by defining a rough draft of our component API here.\nLet's keep going with our\nHeadline component as an example. We're starting with the following properties:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Select the headline level to use, or p alternatively|\n|Select the headline style to use|\n|Choose an alignment for the headline|\n|Text content for the headline|\n|Text content for the optional subheadline|\n|Add additional spacing to the bottom of the headline|\n|Additional Classes|\n|Optional custom component identifier|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\nFor the detailed documentation have a look at the\nHeadline in our\n**Storybook** here:\nhttps://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-headline--h-1\nOne potential set of props, it's also the one used in our guide \"Customize\nHeadline component\" if you're wondering, would be the following:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Text content of headline|\n|Subheadline content|\n|Switch order of headline and subheadline|\n|Level of headline to use|\n|Style of headline to show|\n|Whether to display space after headline|\nWe took\nlevel and\nspaceAfter directly, and renamed\nsubheadline to\nsub,\nstyleAs to\nstyle and\ncontent to\ntext for our version of the\nHeadline. And crucially we add our own property\nswitchOrder into the mix. Required fields are marked with a\n* again.\n### 2. Component Creation\nIn the second and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\n**JSON Schema**, and create a **React** template matching our selected properties to the **kickstartDS** base component. While creating that template, we'll add the markup changes necessary to fit our additional requirement into the component.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\n**JSON Schema** for them, defining their component API in code. This time we add our own, new property into the mix.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nHeadline again (adding our own\nswitchOrder property):\n#### Original\nHeadline\nThis is the \"full\" headline component API /\n**JSON Schema**. We've just reduced the property definitions.\n#### Select from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\n#### Create your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\n**JSON Schema**...\n#### Renaming props\n... and rename props in the process.\n#### Add our new prop\nMost importantly, we add our new property.\n#### Add\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\n#### Finished component\n**JSON Schema**\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\n##### Customizing multiple properties\nThis process can also involve customizing a component by adding multiple properties to it. Just repeat all the steps for every property you'll need to add.\nIn general: these guides are mainly meant as basic building blocks, that can be combined and remixed by you to create exactly what you need... even if that's something more complex than described in these basic guides here.\nFor the full version of customizing a\nHeadline have a look at our \"Customize\nHeadline component\" guide.\n**React** template\nNow that our\n**JSON Schema** is defined, we'll automatically get matching **TypeScript** types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the **kickstartDS** base component, to quickly hook up our set of properties to the original component. Using auto-complete, and **TypeScript** telling us about required properties in the base component, this is gets easy like squeezing a lemon!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nHeadline, creating the component template:\n##### Necessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\n**kickstartDS** base component, a rendering function being capable of rendering **Markdown** and our own components **TypeScript** types.\nUnlike the adapt, create and extend processes we don't actually need the\nHeadlineContextDefault, because we'll add our own markup... based on the original\n**kickstartDS** base components markup.\n##### Defining\nRenderFunctions\nWe define the render functions interface that will enable our RTE-like functionality for the\ntext and\nsub properties.\n##### Add correct type to component\nWe need to type our\n**React** component to use our **JSON Schema**, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly and our render functions are understood. For the\nHeadline this means including\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, as it maps to a\n<div> under the hood, and our\nRenderFunctions interface.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\nAnd in the case of the\nHeadline, we also include our rendering functions.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nUnlike when directly adapting or extending a\n**kickstartDS** base component, we can't use some imported component directly. We need to reference the template of the original component we're customizing, to copy the parts that need customizing.\nFor the\nHeadline this means copying and customizing this template.\n##### Destructure additional props\nWe start with the\nprops we're carrying through first. We add those to the root\n<header> element, like in the original component.\n##### Adjustments to copied template markup 1/3\nThis is where we actually customize the original components markup.\nFor the\nHeadline we drop properties we don't use (e.g.\nclassName), add hard coded values for others required but not part of our component API (e.g.\nalign) and rename the ones we've given another name to (e.g.\nstyleAs vs\nstyle)\n##### Adjustments to copied template markup 2/3\nThe real custommization lies in adding the\nsubheadline /\nsub in two places, before\n**and** after the main headline content.

{"url": "https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/guides/create/components", "content": {"raw": "4. Add Components\nNow we'll get to the meat of it... adding our first set of components based on\nkickstartDS. Which ones you'll utimately need, and subsequentially build, can vary wildly based on your specific Design System needs. We'll add some exemplary ones now, to illustrate the main ways on offer to do this: Adding a\nButtoncomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/button,\nto show the process of\nadaptingan existing component Adding a\nHeadlinecomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/headline,\nto show the process of\ncustomizingan existing component Adding a\nTeaserCardcomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/teaser-box,\nto show the process of\ncreatinga new component Adding a\nSectioncomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/section,\nto show the process of\nextendingan existing component\nWe'll then build our first recipe, using all of the added components to create a teaser component for articles. Recipes are like loose blueprints, that should serve as an inspiration for how components can be combined and remixed, to fit a multitude of use cases! To learn more about recipes, and different kinds of components, we recommend reading\nBrad Frosts excellent article on \"design system components, recipes, and snowflakes\".\nAnd to bring it full circle, we will add that component to our\nWelcome page to tease the main pages of our Storybook, as a quick entry for users!\nFeel free to change these examplary components being implemented around to something you'll actually need instead, if you happen to have something in mind already.\nWe'll try adding some components that are commonly needed, so it should be a good starting point either way!\nIf you want to take a deeper dive on finding your first component set right now, jump over to our guide around the\nDesign System Initiative, and come back to this point later!\nAnd if all of this feels overwhelming, or like too much work for you to do on your own or your team, feel free to also have a look at the services we offer around Design Systems and\nkickstartDS. They're in no way a necessity to use kickstartDS, but we're always happy to help in getting your first Design System, a Design System Initiative or internal DesignOps team off the ground!\nEstablish structure\nBefore we get into the components themselves, we need to do a last bit of setup that will be needed by all of them.\nThis includes setting up some\nReact constructs like\nProviders, that ensure our own components get used everywhere (including when part of another component), hooking up\nJavaScript and CSS / SCSS integration and compilation, making sure our TypeScript types are available for users of our components, and finally creating some new\nscripts entries in\npackage.json to improve our own developer experience when working on the Design System.\nAdd component\nProviders\nAll components in\nkickstartDS come with their own\nProvider. This enables you to switch component implementations at will. From sweeping changes like switching all\nButtons for your own custom\nButton, including the ones that are part of other, bigger components, or surgical changes like just replacing the\nButton that gets used in a\nTeaser Box specifically.\nTo have that benefit for our own users, too, we'll add the same general structure to our Design System here.\nAggregate global\nProviders\nWe first create a file\nProviders.jsx at\nsrc/components/. This will import all of our global component providers, which are mainly the ones deep replacing\nkickstartDS components, and export a single member that can be used to import and integrate all providers at once, reducing the need for copy & pasted code.\nAnd as we haven't created it before, it's now time to create\nsrc/components:\n_1mkdir -p src/components\n... create the file...\n_1touch src/components/Providers.jsx\n... and add the following content to it:\nFor now this will not do anything, but we'll hook it up to\nStorybook in the next step... and then subsequently build it up when adding components.\nUpdate\n.storybook/preview.js\nIntegration with\nStorybook is done in\n.storybook/preview.js again, as this is related to how components are rendered / previewed. Just add the following lines to it:\nAdd\nProvider decorator to\nStorybook\nWe start by importing our (still empty)\nProviders that we created, and adding them to the\ndecorators array.\nAdd\nProvider to docs pages\nWe also add the\nProviders to the\ndocs rendering of\nStorybook.\nAdd\nunpack decorator to Storybook\nWhile at it, we also add the\nunpack decorator to our Storybook. This decorator is provided by kickstartDS as part of\n@kickstartDS/core, and is used to unpack arguments provided to the component, rendered as part of a Story.\ncode formatting bug\nAttention: there's a code formatting bug with the code above. The following line\nwindow._ks.radio.on(\"*\", myActions.radio); should read\nwindow._ks.radio.on(\"\", myActions.radio);\nWe'll hopefully be able to fix this soon!\nThis concludes the\nStorybook* integration!\npack, unpack, story args... huh?\nkickstartDS offers helpers you can use to automatically configure your stories Storybook Controls. If used, you'll automatically get Controls and respective documentation based on your component API ( JSON Schema).\nBecause nesting Controls isn't straight-forward, we've written those helpers (\npack,\nunpack) that take complex JSON, and, as the name suggests,\npack those into an object with flattened keys compatible with the Controls addon (much like a library like\nflat does it).\nAdd\npackage.json\nscripts\nGood\nscripts entries in your\npackage.json help new users when learning about your Design System, while also offering way better developer experience for everyone else. Aggregated commands to quickly start everything in development / watch mode, to compile everything for production, or for generating a new release mean taking complexities away from the average developer, while granular commands, used by those aggregate commands under the hood, allow for maximal flexibility.\nTo aggregate some commands, we add the package\nnpm-run-all to the project. It can be used to run multiple commands either sequentially or parallelized. We also add\nchokidarcli to listen for file change events, and re-trigger commands for hot reload:\n_1yarn add npm-run-all chokidar-cli --dev\nWe then add the following\nscripts entries to our\npackage.json now:\nUnchanged\npackage.json\nThis is how your\npackage.json should look like currently.\nAdd aggregated\nschema script\nWe add a command aggregating schema dereferencing and props generation for us in\nschema.\nrun-p schema:* runs all commands prefixed with\nschema: in parallel.\nAdd prefix to schema related tasks\nWe now move all schema related tasks to using that\nschema prefix.\nAdd token and schema handling to\nbuild-storybook\nMake sure everything is compiled, before building\nStorybook.\nAdd additional\nwatch tasks\nWe now add\nwatch tasks for\nschema and\ndictionary, using\nchokidar.\nschema: regenerates component API and TypeScript types on schema change\ndictionary: regenerates your CSS Custom Properties on\nStyle Dictionarychange\nAdd\nstart command\nWe can use that in development, to start everything with hot reload because of the watchers we've added.\nFinished\npackage.json\nYour\npackage.json should look like this now!\nUnchanged\npackage.json\nThis is how your\npackage.json should look like currently.\nAdd aggregated\nschema script\nWe add a command aggregating schema dereferencing and props generation for us in\nschema.\nrun-p schema:* runs all commands prefixed with\nschema: in parallel.\nAdd prefix to schema related tasks\nWe now move all schema related tasks to using that\nschema prefix.\nAdd token and schema handling to\nbuild-storybook\nMake sure everything is compiled, before building\nStorybook.\nAdd additional\nwatch tasks\nWe now add\nwatch tasks for\nschema and\ndictionary, using\nchokidar.\nschema: regenerates component API and TypeScript types on schema change\ndictionary: regenerates your CSS Custom Properties on\nStyle Dictionarychange\nAdd\nstart command\nWe can use that in development, to start everything with hot reload because of the watchers we've added.\nFinished\npackage.json\nYour\npackage.json should look like this now!\nFeel free to start your\nStorybook now by just calling the\nstart command:\n_1yarn start\nIsn't that convenient? üòÖ Now everything is set up to start the fun part: adding components!\nComponent implementation\nWe roughly see four different ways of adding a component to your Design System, in the context of\nkickstartDS. Those are most definitely not exhausting, but they serve as a good introduction: Adapta component (\nButton)\nCreatea component (\nHeadline)\nCustomizea component (\nTeaserCard)\nExtenda component (\nSection)\nWe'll follow one guide for each of those general workflows, resulting in the four planned components being added to our Design System. In the real world the truth is not that clear cut, at least most of the time. Typically you'd probably have a mix of those scenarios.\nFeel free to just add the components as shown in the guides for now, every if you'll change those later for real use. You can always adapt them further at a later point! You can also skip the exhaustive component example guides, if you just want to copy & paste along. We'll always include the respective code snapshots to do that!\nTo learn about finding components to implement, have a look at the Design System Initiative guide.\n1. Adding our own\nButton component\nTo demonstrate the first, and easiest, way of adding a component to your own Design System we will adapt a\nButton component.\nThis also serves as an example for\nadapting a component, where we mostly take a component directly from kickstartDS, while still finding our own, often more restrictive, component API for it.\nThe result will look like this:\nChoose your own adventure:\n|Path||Link|\n|Follow the Component example guide||Adapt |\n|Read the process description||Adapt a component|\n|Look at the Code Sandbox||see below|\nSee the completed example in a\nCode Sandbox below:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n2. Adding our own\nHeadline component\nThe second way of adding a component involves much of the same steps we've seen for the\nButton already. That's not a coincidence, as every process should involve following the steps outlined by the adaptation process. It's like a base process that gets inherited, because reducing the offered properties into your own component API is essential!\nIn addition to that process we customize the component with this one. We add our own property\nswitchOrder to switch the order of headline and subheadline. Not a feature of the\nkickstartDS base\nHeadline normally. This results in us having to change the\nReact template, which makes this customizing, compared to example to extension. We also add RTE-like rendering capabilities to the content fields.\nWe have a dedicated guide for customization, too, explaining the concepts a bit more in-depth.\nThe result will look like this:\nChoose your own adventure:\n|Path||Link|\n|Follow the Component example guide||Customize |\n|Read the process description||Customize a component|\n|Look at the Code Sandbox||see below|\nSee the completed example in a\nCode Sandbox below:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n3. Adding our own\nTeaserCard component\nFor the third way of adding a component we add a\nTeaserCard to our Design System. This is not a component we will build while having a\nkickstartDS base component in mind, yet.

You can also view this on Github directly in the\nds-guide repository, there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on the branch\nstep/4 in the guide:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.", "markdown": "# 4. Add Components\nNow we'll get to the meat of it... adding our first set of components based on\n**kickstartDS**. Which ones you'll utimately need, and subsequentially build, can vary wildly based on your specific Design System needs. We'll add some exemplary ones now, to illustrate the main ways on offer to do this: Adding a\nButtoncomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/button,\nto show the process of\nadaptingan existing component Adding a\nHeadlinecomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/headline,\nto show the process of\ncustomizingan existing component Adding a\nTeaserCardcomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/teaser-box,\nto show the process of\ncreatinga new component Adding a\nSectioncomponent\nbased on\n@kickstartds/base/lib/section,\nto show the process of\nextendingan existing component\nWe'll then build our first recipe, using all of the added components to create a teaser component for articles. Recipes are like loose blueprints, that should serve as an inspiration for how components can be combined and remixed, to fit a multitude of use cases! To learn more about recipes, and different kinds of components, we recommend reading\n**Brad Frosts** excellent article on \"design system components, recipes, and snowflakes\".\nAnd to bring it full circle, we will add that component to our\n*Welcome* page to tease the main pages of our **Storybook**, as a quick entry for users!\nFeel free to change these examplary components being implemented around to something you'll actually need instead, if you happen to have something in mind already.\nWe'll try adding some components that are commonly needed, so it should be a good starting point either way!\nIf you want to take a deeper dive on finding your first component set right now, jump over to our guide around the\nDesign System Initiative, and come back to this point later!\nAnd if all of this feels overwhelming, or like too much work for you to do on your own or your team, feel free to also have a look at the services we offer around Design Systems and\n**kickstartDS**. They're in no way a necessity to use **kickstartDS**, but we're always happy to help in getting your first Design System, a Design System Initiative or internal DesignOps team off the ground!\n## Establish structure\nBefore we get into the components themselves, we need to do a last bit of setup that will be needed by all of them.\nThis includes setting up some\n**React** constructs like\nProviders, that ensure our own components get used everywhere (including when part of another component), hooking up\n**JavaScript** and **CSS** / **SCSS** integration and compilation, making sure our **TypeScript** types are available for users of our components, and finally creating some new\nscripts entries in\npackage.json to improve our own developer experience when working on the Design System.\n### Add component\nProviders\nAll components in\n**kickstartDS** come with their own\nProvider. This enables you to switch component implementations at will. From sweeping changes like switching all\nButtons for your own custom\nButton, including the ones that are part of other, bigger components, or surgical changes like just replacing the\nButton that gets used in a\nTeaser Box specifically.\nTo have that benefit for our own users, too, we'll add the same general structure to our Design System here.\n#### Aggregate global\nProviders\nWe first create a file\nProviders.jsx at\nsrc/components/. This will import all of our global component providers, which are mainly the ones deep replacing\n**kickstartDS** components, and export a single member that can be used to import and integrate **all** providers at once, reducing the need for copy & pasted code.\nAnd as we haven't created it before, it's now time to create\nsrc/components:\n_1mkdir -p src/components\n... create the file...\n_1touch src/components/Providers.jsx\n... and add the following content to it:\nFor now this will not do anything, but we'll hook it up to\n**Storybook** in the next step... and then subsequently build it up when adding components.\n#### Update\n.storybook/preview.js\nIntegration with\n**Storybook** is done in\n.storybook/preview.js again, as this is related to how components are rendered / previewed. Just add the following lines to it:\n#### Add\nProvider decorator to\n**Storybook**\nWe start by importing our (still empty)\nProviders that we created, and adding them to the\ndecorators array.\n#### Add\nProvider to docs pages\nWe also add the\nProviders to the\ndocs rendering of\n**Storybook**.\n#### Add\n**unpack** decorator to **Storybook**\nWhile at it, we also add the\n**unpack** decorator to our **Storybook**. This decorator is provided by **kickstartDS** as part of\n@kickstartDS/core, and is used to unpack arguments provided to the component, rendered as part of a Story.\n##### code formatting bug\nAttention: there's a code formatting bug with the code above. The following line\nwindow.\\_ks.radio.on(\"\\*\", myActions.radio); should read\nwindow._ks.radio.on(\"*\", myActions.radio);\nWe'll hopefully be able to fix this soon!\nThis concludes the\n**Storybook** integration!\n##### pack, unpack, story args... huh?\n**kickstartDS** offers helpers you can use to automatically configure your stories **Storybook Controls**. If used, you'll automatically get **Controls** and respective documentation based on your component API ( **JSON Schema**).\nBecause nesting Controls isn't straight-forward, we've written those helpers (\npack,\nunpack) that take complex JSON, and, as the name suggests,\npack those into an object with flattened keys compatible with the Controls addon (much like a library like\nflat does it).\n### Add\npackage.json\nscripts\nGood\nscripts entries in your\npackage.json help new users when learning about your Design System, while also offering way better developer experience for everyone else. Aggregated commands to quickly start everything in development / watch mode, to compile everything for production, or for generating a new release mean taking complexities away from the average developer, while granular commands, used by those aggregate commands under the hood, allow for maximal flexibility.\nTo aggregate some commands, we add the package\nnpm-run-all to the project. It can be used to run multiple commands either sequentially or parallelized. We also add\nchokidarcli to listen for file change events, and re-trigger commands for hot reload:\n_1yarn add npm-run-all chokidar-cli --dev\nWe then add the following\nscripts entries to our\npackage.json now:\n#### Unchanged\npackage.json\nThis is how your\npackage.json should look like currently.\n#### Add aggregated\nschema script\nWe add a command aggregating schema dereferencing and props generation for us in\nschema.\nrun-p schema:* runs all commands prefixed with\nschema: in parallel.\n#### Add prefix to schema related tasks\nWe now move all schema related tasks to using that\nschema prefix.\n#### Add token and schema handling to\nbuild-storybook\nMake sure everything is compiled, before building\n**Storybook**.\n#### Add additional\nwatch tasks\nWe now add\nwatch tasks for\nschema and\ndictionary, using\nchokidar.\nschema: regenerates component API and TypeScript types on schema change\ndictionary: regenerates your CSS Custom Properties on\nStyle Dictionarychange\n#### Add\nstart command\nWe can use that in development, to start everything with hot reload because of the watchers we've added.\n#### Finished\npackage.json\nYour\npackage.json should look like this now!\n#### Unchanged\npackage.json\nThis is how your\npackage.json should look like currently.\n#### Add aggregated\nschema script\nWe add a command aggregating schema dereferencing and props generation for us in\nschema.\nrun-p schema:* runs all commands prefixed with\nschema: in parallel.\n#### Add prefix to schema related tasks\nWe now move all schema related tasks to using that\nschema prefix.\n#### Add token and schema handling to\nbuild-storybook\nMake sure everything is compiled, before building\n**Storybook**.\n#### Add additional\nwatch tasks\nWe now add\nwatch tasks for\nschema and\ndictionary, using\nchokidar.\nschema: regenerates component API and TypeScript types on schema change\ndictionary: regenerates your CSS Custom Properties on\nStyle Dictionarychange\n#### Add\nstart command\nWe can use that in development, to start everything with hot reload because of the watchers we've added.\n#### Finished\npackage.json\nYour\npackage.json should look like this now!\nFeel free to start your\n**Storybook** now by just calling the\nstart command:\n_1yarn start\nIsn't that convenient? üòÖ Now everything is set up to start the fun part: adding components!\n## Component implementation\nWe roughly see four different ways of adding a component to your Design System, in the context of\n**kickstartDS**. Those are most definitely not exhausting, but they serve as a good introduction: Adapta component (\nButton)\nCreatea component (\nHeadline)\nCustomizea component (\nTeaserCard)\nExtenda component (\nSection)\nWe'll follow one guide for each of those general workflows, resulting in the four planned components being added to our Design System. In the real world the truth is not that clear cut, at least most of the time. Typically you'd probably have a mix of those scenarios.\nFeel free to just add the components as shown in the guides for now, every if you'll change those later for real use. You can always adapt them further at a later point! You can also skip the exhaustive component example guides, if you just want to copy & paste along. We'll always include the respective code snapshots to do that!\nTo learn about finding components to implement, have a look at the Design System Initiative guide.\n### 1. Adding our own\nButton component\nTo demonstrate the first, and easiest, way of adding a component to your own Design System we will adapt a\nButton component.\nThis also serves as an example for\n**adapting** a component, where we mostly take a component directly from **kickstartDS**, while still finding our own, often more restrictive, component API for it.\nThe result will look like this:\nChoose your own adventure:\n|Path||Link|\n|Follow the Component example guide||Adapt |\n|Read the process description||Adapt a component|\n|Look at the Code Sandbox||see below|\nSee the completed example in a\n**Code Sandbox** below:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n### 2. Adding our own\nHeadline component\nThe second way of adding a component involves much of the same steps we've seen for the\nButton already. That's not a coincidence, as every process should involve following the steps outlined by the adaptation process. It's like a base process that gets inherited, because reducing the offered properties into your own component API is essential!\nIn addition to that process we customize the component with this one. We add our own property\nswitchOrder to switch the order of headline and subheadline. Not a feature of the\n**kickstartDS** base\nHeadline normally. This results in us having to change the\n**React** template, which makes this customizing, compared to example to extension. We also add RTE-like rendering capabilities to the content fields.\nWe have a dedicated guide for customization, too, explaining the concepts a bit more in-depth.\nThe result will look like this:\nChoose your own adventure:\n|Path||Link|\n|Follow the Component example guide||Customize |\n|Read the process description||Customize a component|\n|Look at the Code Sandbox||see below|\nSee the completed example in a\n**Code Sandbox** below:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n### 3. Adding our own\nTeaserCard component\nFor the third way of adding a component we add a\nTeaserCard to our Design System. This is not a component we will build while having a\n**kickstartDS** base component in mind, yet. Instead, we'll start with \"just\" the requirements (this really is the most common scenario, btw., it just builds nicely on the two before). We'll then map those to a component second, and proceed like for the others!\nThis serves as a great example of the creation process. We create something new, but still benefit from all the underlying Design System goodness.\nThe result will look like this:\nChoose your own adventure:\n|Path||Link|\n|Follow the Component example guide||Create |\n|Read the process description||Customize a component|\n|Look at the Code Sandbox||see below|\nSee the completed example in a\n**Code Sandbox** below:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.\n### 4. Adding our own\nSection component\nFor the last component, we'll add a\nSection that can be used to combine all of the components we've added before to create our first composable use cases! We take it from the\n**kickstartDS** base component pretty much verbatim.

It creates a ready-to-use Design System, only waiting for you to put your stamp on it! Next to some additional features and configuration, the content of this starter is strongly aligned with our main guide \"Create your Design System\". This means you can use that guide as a detailed reference for the way stuff works, and learn about the reasoning behind those decisions.\nOverview\nThis\nStarter repository can serve as the starting point for your own Design System. It only includes minimal, but illustrative, example components and integrations. The selected components should be useful in every Design System by themselves, but they're specifically used to showcase features and best practices at play in kickstartDS, and to make it easier for you to just add stuff to an already working, well-oiled system.\nWe have extensive documentation building up most of the code you'll find in this starter from scratch. The respective guide \"Create your Design System\" can thus serve as a great reference whilst exploring this starter on your own, or when having specific questions about a feature or integration.\nFeature list\nThe following is a list of included features, that are pre-configured for immediate use:\n- Ready-to-start, fully functional\nDesign System\n- Pre-configured semantic token structure (\nBranding Token, Design Tokenand Component Token) Branding Tokenfile for quick application of CI / CD\n- Three exemplary components (\nButton,\nHeadlineand\nTeaserCard) and a layout element (\nSection)\n- Full page demo, recipe demo and rudimentary demo docs\nStorybookwith best-practice configuration, kickstartDSintegration, addons and composition Hot reloadfor allcode changes: Design Tokenset, JSON Schema, CSS/ SCSS, JavaScriptand Reacttemplates Playroomintegration for prototyping\n- Bundling of\nDesign Systemfor use with andwithout React\n- Automatic, semantic release handling using\nauto\n- CI / CD integration for\nCircle CI\nSee the dedicated section about the main features below for more detailed descriptions.\nInstallation\nThere's not really anything you need to install globally to use\nkickstartDS. But as it is Node.js based, you'll have to have that at the ready. This starter (just like the rest of kickstartDS) tracks the current LTS release, switching to new ones as soon as all the tooling has stabilized.\nInstall Node.js with nvm\nWe recommend managing your local\nNode.js versions using\nnvm. Read through the corresponding\nsection in our docs.\nTo learn more generally about the optimal environment to work with\nkickstartDS have a look at the Environment page in our docs.\nGetting started (in 5 minutes)\nLet's get started creating your own\nDesign System! We should be done with the basic setup in just 5 easy steps, taking you 5 minutes max!\n1. Create from template\nFirst thing is creating your repository based on this template. This will be the repository you manage your\nDesign System in, your central source of truth!\nJust follow this excellent guide by\nGithub themselves:\nCreating a repository from a template\nAlternatively you can also just fork / clone the repository, and host your code how- and wherever you like. There's no further dependency on\nGithub here... it's just convenient.\nAs a last step, simply clone your freshly made repository, and switch into its directory in preparation for the next step.\nClone? Directory? Huh...\nNot sure where anything like this would happen? Have a look at the \"Terminal\" section in our docs.\n2. Update\npackage.json\nAfter checkout, you should start by adding some meta info to\npackage.json... like\nname for the name of your project. Among other things, this will also decide the name your\nDesign System will be published under in npm. Other fields you might want to change include:\nversion,\ndescription,\nhomepage,\nlicense and\nauthor. Have a look at the\nnpm docs for\npackage.json for all the juicy details.\nAnd while at it, you should probably also change the author in the following files:\nCOPYRIGHT.md\nLICENSE-APACHE\nLICENSE-MIT\nREADME.md\n.autorc\n3. Add your own logo\nLast thing to do before installing and starting everything is to replace the placeholder logo with your own one. Just replace\nstatic/logo.svg, and you should be good to go!\nOther image formats\nIf you don't have a\n.svg file for your logo (you really should have one!),\nyou can just put that file into the\nstatic/ folder, and change the reference\nin\n.storybook/themes.js to point to that instead.\n4. Install dependencies\nContinue by checking your\nNode.js version (or execute\nnvm use if you opted for the\nnvm route) with\nnode --version. It should output\n16.14 for this starter.\nFollow this with a\nyarn or npm install:\n_1yarn install\n_1npm install\nThis should set up all the needed dependencies. It could take a while the first time around, so while that's running... why not take a peek at the features section?\nUsing npm\nWe use\nyarn for package management ourselves, including their workspaces feature...\nJust replace commands prefixed with\nyarn by their corresponding\nnpm equivalents if using\nnpm\n5. Start\nStorybook\nWhen the installation of dependencies is done, everything should be ready to start your own\nDesign System for the very first time:\n_1yarn start\nStorybook should automatically open in your preferred browser, showing you a demo \"Welcome\" page with some dummy content.\nyarn start here is actually an alias starting all configured watch tasks, in parallel to also starting\nStorybook in watch mode. This ensures that whatever file you edit, you should have hot reload while working on your code!\nHave a look at the next section for inspiration on what the next steps could look like on the journey to your customized\nDesign System.\nNext steps\nWhere you take it next is pretty much up to you completely. There are some things one would pretty much always want to do (e.g. Customizing Design Token), while others might be optional. In which order you tackle those shouldn't make a difference, just choose what fancies you the most!\nCustomizing\nDesign Token\nWhen getting started with your\nDesign System, you will find the current Design Token set to be pretty bland and boring... this is because you are looking at the default, pretty much unstyled versions of components.\nThere are two concepts involved with design and token application in\nkickstartDS: Branding Token: Small set of expressive values to seed your initial Design Tokenset Design Token: Managed Style Dictionarycontaining your semantic Design Tokenset Branding Token are set in\nsrc/token/branding-token.json, while your\nDesign Token set lives at\nsrc/token/dictionary. Initialization of token happens through\nyarn init-tokens, while compiling your\nDesign Token set to Component Token (among other formats) is done by running\nyarn build-tokens.\nComponent Token are the third type of token involved, but those only come into play later. They are not concerned with the general styling / theming of your Design System, but rather map your Design Token set to components in a layered way.\nTo learn more about this process, follow the section \"2. Design Application\" of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nAdding components\nAs described in the intro to this\nREADME, the components already included serve as a great example on how to leverage\nkickstartDS. But obviously you will want to add your own components, suited to exactly your needs!\nWe have to tried to outline this process of component creation, and all its aspects, in our documentation. All the components included with this starter get created in part of \"4. Add Components\" of our main guide \"Create your Design System\". You can use that guide to cross-reference the thought process behind the components already included, and it should give you a good idea on how to approach your own ones.\nYou can have a look at all the component examples in our guides here, or learn about the involved processes in more detail in the \"Components\" subsection.\nFuther, all the aspects making up a component are described as part of the \"Component\" subsection under \"Foundations\".\nIf unsure on what components you actually need, or which ones to tackle first, you could investigate starting your own Design System Initiative. We also wrote about it in a blog post, and offer support in executing one... if you still feel like you need a helping hand!\nDig into our docs\nWe have added a lot of links to specific docs sections in all the other paragraphs already. But they deserve a special mention here. Creating a\nDesign System can be both highly custom and opinionated. This is why we think explaining our reasoning in detail, especially when we take decisions for you (like using Style Dictionary), is super important. And for areas where there is no clear cut decision to take, we always try to add recommendations (like how to best construct your components to avoid adding technical debt) instead.\nSome quick links to get you started:\n|Link||Description|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/||Start page, good intro to the general structure of our docs|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/intro/||Super general introduction of |kickstartDS, including YouTube explanation\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/foundations/||Foundational info about the structure and architecture of |kickstartDS\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/integration/||Info about the ways |kickstartDS integrates with other tooling and systems\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/||Focused guides, categorized into the main areas of a |Design System\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/create/||Main guide, also a great reference for the reasoning behind this starter|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/feedback/||All the ways you can provide feedback to us, which we value a lot!|\nFeatures\nThis starter is already quite rich in features that are enabled out-of-the-box for you. To give you some orientation, while also describing the intention behind features, and ensuring you can actually make the most out of your\nDesign System.\nDesign Token integration\nOne important part of a\nDesign System is having a well structured and semantic token system in place. Learn about customizing your Design Token set in our dedicated section above, helping you to adapt your own branding / CI / CD. Design Token can be initialized by changing the values in\nsrc/token/branding-token.json and calling\nyarn init-tokens, and compiled to\nCSS Custom Properties by running\nyarn build-tokens. While\nyarn init-tokens generates your\nDesign Token set in\nsrc/token/dictionary,\nyarn build-tokens reads it from there, and outputs the resulting formats (which\nCSS Custom Properties is just one of) according to your Style Dictionary config.\nWe already include a minimal\nStyle Dictionary configuration as part of our CLI, but you can overwrite this configuration by adding a\nsd.config.cjs to your repository root. Explore that file for details on the formats configured in this starter (the path the format output is written to can be influenced by setting\nbuildPath):\n|Platform||Description|\ncss |Creates a |Design Token converted to CSS Custom Properties, using the naming structure expected by Component Token in\nhtml HTML icon sprite (learn more), that is needed when integrating raw HTML (e.g. into PHP, ASP.NET, or similar). Also serves as the central icon file read by the storybook-design-token addon. Added as\njsx React version of the same file as the one above, this should be used when working with React directly. Called\nstorybook |Writes a selection of files (|storybook-design-token addon\njs |This also creates a file (|Storybook, to add some light theming to your instance based on your Design Token set.\nAlso included is a set of\nStorybook pages documenting your Design Token set, using aforementioned storybook-design-token addon. You can find them in\ndocs/tokens, feel free to adjust them to your liking!\nYou can also have a look at our\nFigma token file visualizing exactly that token structure:\nTo learn more about\nDesign Token and their support in kickstartDS read our first release spotlight: Release Spotlight: Semantic Token.\nStorybook integration\nSome aspects of our integration with\nStorybook were already covered by the last section about Design Token integration. But let's quickly outline all of the integration points:\n|Integration||Description|\nJSON Schema Storybook addon written by us, to display your component API directly alongside your component (includes inline JSON editor using Monaco, with auto-complete).\nDesign Token |Integration with |storybook-design-token addon, read more about it on our integration page about it. Also included are Storybook pages documenting your Design Token set... you can find them in\nComponent Token |Another |Storybook addon we made. Visualizes your layered Component Token, and enables changing values interactively. Changed values get stored in session storage, allowing you to test them throughout your whole Design System.\nGenerated Controls |Your component API (|JSON Schema files defining your components structure) get converted to Storybook Controls automatically. Learn more about this zero-config setup in our dedicated integrations page about it.\nPremade Stories |Especially when adapting components closely, you can benefit from our |Storybook exports. We take great care to export everything (parameters, variants, general setup) for you to re-use while writing your own Stories.\nTheming |Finally some light theming gets applied to your |Storybook instance, based on your Design Token set. It should be subdued, but making Storybook your own really helps in establishing a sense of ownership!\nComposition |As part of the left sidebar you have a section titled |kickstartDS uses Storybook composition to always include the base documentation (in the correct version used by your Design System) to your Storybook. Design Token get compiled using the kickstartDS CLI as part of your\npackage.json. This converts your\nStyle Dictionary from\nsrc/token/dictionary into all the formats configured in\nsd.config.cjs.\nStorybook is configured to import our special, annotated\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.css (this one includes presenters for\nstorybook-design-token) through the import of the compiled\nmanager.css.\nTheming is done in\n.storybook/themes.js, and works by importing our tokens (generated with their own special\nStyle Dictionary format). Those then just get connected into the Storybook theme structure in a sensible way.\nAll the other integrations don't live at\none central place, but instead require configuration per component / Story. So lets look at an example in the\nButton component instead:\nJSON Schemaintegration for the\nButton, loading the dereferenced schema, setting it as a\nStoryparameter, and using the\npackhelper throughout\nButton.stories.jsx. The rest is handled by our\nStorybook JSON Schema Addon. Component Tokenare integrated by importing the generated\nbutton-tokens.json, and then passing that as a parameter to the\nStory. Generation of those files per component is done in\npackage.jsonhere. The rest is handled again by our own addon:\nStorybook Component Tokens Addon. Generated Controlsare enabled by importing the helpers\ngetArgsSharedand\npack, and using them throughout the\nStory. This takes care of generating all the Storybook Controlsautomatically for you, based off your component APIs (the JSON Schemadefinitions). Premade storieswork by importing the base Storyfirst, and then destructuring it into the default export... before setting your own options as overrides.\nReact integration\nThere are some\nReact concepts already in use deep in kickstartDS, and its base components you build upon. This includes using Render Props and adding Context / Provider to all components, both to enable flexible and efficient mix-and-match of components.\nYou can see some examples on how this can be applied in our docs about it. Those concepts also get used throughout our main guide \"Create your Design System\", for example when adding RTE-rendering to the\nHeadline. All components included in this starter are the result of example guides.\nThis also easily enables more advanced integrations for your components to offer, later on. For example, when integrating with a headless CMS like\nSanity, and using existing Render Props to turn our default Markdown capable\nRichText component to one specific to\nSanity, using\nPortableText.\nFor this starter this means having a file\nsrc/Providers.jsx in place, that includes all the needed\nProviders to replace the base components by their customized versions throughout your whole\nDesign System. As we've added our own versions of the\nButton,\nTeaserBox and\nSection components in this starter, those are imported and added. We also support\nBedrock Layout Primitives out-of-the-box, so that provider gets added, too. You can read more about the\nProvider setup in one of our guides here.\nProviders need to be set for\nStorybook, both for previews and the\nDocs container to render components properly. This, too, is covered by our main guide here.\nWhen you need Providers\nWhen you're building a page or application using\nReact, you will need to\nadd those\nProviders to your central layout there!\nBedrock Layout Primitives integration\nFor the most common use cases we include the\nSection component with\nkickstartDS, and it's adapted for this Design System starter, too. It even includes some customizations here, as described in our component example guide \"Extend\nSection component`.\nThe\nSection component is especially well suited for marketing and landing pages. It provdides general layout options (\"horizontal slices\" on a page) for components to be put in. You can see all available options here:\nStorybook Docs for\nSection.\nWe also cover the\nSection, and some example uses, in more detail in our \"Layout\" section of the docs.\nWhen you have more general layout needs, not covered by simply using a\nSection component, we usually recommend using\nBedrock Layout Primitives for those cases. We think it meshes really well with our approach to Design Token, you simply connect your existing Design Token set to their theming approach. We already provide such an integration with this starter. You can read about this combination in more detail on our \"Foundations\" page about Bedrock Layout Primitives.\nTo learn more about\nBedrock Layout Primitves and why, when and how to use it with kickstartDS, and when Container Queries might actually be preferrable, you can also read our second release spotlight: Release Spotlight: Container Queries.\nPlayroom integration\nWe're big proponents of prototyping interface as close to your real\nDesign System as possible. For developers, and even code-affine designers, we really love the DX Playroom by seek-oss offers for this.\nThis is why we've included a\nPlayroom integration with this starter (and because it's actually really easy to do with the way kickstartDS is set up) at\nplayroom.config.js.\nThere's some configuration in\nStorybooks\n.storybook/preview.js, and all components that should be enabled need to be added in\nsrc/playroom/components.ts. We also added\nBedrock Layout Primitives support out-of-the-box, there.\nTo change the included\nSnippets edit\nsrc/playroom/snippets.ts, and to change the theme integration (or even to add multiple themes / white-label testing capabilities to it) have a look at\nsrc/playroom/FrameComponent.tsx and the folder\nsrc/playroom/themes.\nFinally,\nTypeScript support for all your (and our kickstartDS base) components is also already configured. This enables auto-complete for all components, making it really easy and playful to discover components and their properties!\nStart your\nPlayroom:\n_1yarn playroom\nCombined use with Storybook\nYou can even use\nPlayroom in your\nStorybook as\nan addon, just be sure start Playroom before starting Storybook.\nBecause you guessed it: it's already set up!\nBundling\nWith this starter we want to cover the complete life-cycle of a\nDesign System. This includes Bundling and Release handling. We also want to show what we mean when we say kickstartDS is framework-agnostic.\nBecause you can either use a\nDesign System based on kickstartDS by working with React templates directly, or by alternatively using CSS and JavaScript bundles to be used with the raw markup generated by components... both cases are covered in this starter.\nIt's also quite common for both types of usage to coexist for your\nDesign System. Your main marketing page might be built with a headless CMS and a modern stack using React, while some arcane internal tooling might still use PHP for its templating. This setup enables you to serve both!\nAll bundling is handled by the\ndist:* tasks in\npackage.json.\nBundling for\nHTML usage CSS bundling with Dart Sass is done by the\ndist:sass script in\npackage.json. Just be sure to add all needed component\nCSS to\nsrc/dist.scss, the compiled output will live at\ndist/index.css.\nJavaScript bundling with esbuild is done by the\ndist:js script in\npackage.json. As with\nCSS, be sure to add all needed component JavaScript to\nsrc/dist.js, the compiled output will live at\ndist/index.js.\nNext to all that configuration, as a start the included \"Integration\"\nStory describes this process to potential developers using your Design System this way.\nBundling for\nReact usage\nConsumable\nReact component versions are bundled by\ndist:components in\npackage.json. This also uses\nesbuild under the hood, for details about its implementation see\nscripts/bundleComponents.js.\nRelease handling\nRelease handling for this starter is configured to use\nauto, and its semantic versioning. We use this setup for kickstartDS itself, you can learn more about it in our documentation.\nConfiguration is added in\n.autorc, and if you want to enable releases as part of your\nCI / CD... you can use Circle CI with the included configuration file at\n.circleci/config.yml.\nWe will probably expand on this section, when we have a better picture of everyones setup and needs!\nVisual Regression Testing with Chromatic\nOne of the relatively undocumented features is\nVisual Regression\nTesting\nwith Chromatic. This is prepared to be\nusable with\nyarn chromatic\n(also compatible with\nCI / CD) in\npackage.json.\nContent\nWe've described all the features extensively now. To wrap up this\nREADME let's quickly summarize everything included from a \"content\" perspective: Components, Pages, Recipes and Docs.\nComponents\nAs described in the very intro to this\nREADME, all the included components should be immediately useful in pretty much every Design System, but they're also specifically used to showcase features and best practices at play in kickstartDS, and to make it easier for you to just add stuff to an already working, well-oiled system:\nRecipes\nWe added one recipe to give you an idea on how you could use those. We've added an\nArticleTeaser recipe, as one entry in the more general\nArticle recipe category.\nRecipes are useful to show how your existing components can be re-used, re-mixed and re-applied to new use cases, avoiding the creation of many specialized components. They serve as great inspiration for consumers of your\nDesign System, while also slightly nudging in a certain direction by the examples you decide to showcase!\nPages\nThere is one\nPage currently included with this starter in\nsrc/pages/Demo.story.jsx, added to\nStorybook by\nsrc/pages/Pages.stories.jsx.\nDocs\nThere are two docs pages (the\nWelcome page and the Integration page), and documentation for all token from your Design Token set, included with this starter.

Install dependencies\nContinue by checking your\n**Node.js** version (or execute\nnvm use if you opted for the\n**nvm** route) with\nnode --version. It should output\n16.14 for this starter.\nFollow this with a\n**yarn** or **npm** install:\n_1yarn install\n_1npm install\nThis should set up all the needed dependencies. It could take a while the first time around, so while that's running... why not take a peek at the features section?\n##### Using npm\nWe use\nyarn for package management ourselves, including their workspaces feature...\nJust replace commands prefixed with\nyarn by their corresponding\nnpm equivalents if using\n**npm**\n### 5. Start\n**Storybook**\nWhen the installation of dependencies is done, everything should be ready to start your own\n**Design System** for the very first time:\n_1yarn start\n**Storybook** should automatically open in your preferred browser, showing you a demo \"Welcome\" page with some dummy content.\nyarn start here is actually an alias starting all configured watch tasks, in parallel to also starting\n**Storybook** in watch mode. This ensures that whatever file you edit, you should have hot reload while working on your code!\nHave a look at the next section for inspiration on what the next steps could look like on the journey to your customized\n**Design System**.\n## Next steps\nWhere you take it next is pretty much up to you completely. There are some things one would pretty much always want to do (e.g. Customizing Design Token), while others might be optional. In which order you tackle those shouldn't make a difference, just choose what fancies you the most!\n### Customizing\n**Design Token**\nWhen getting started with your\n**Design System**, you will find the current **Design Token** set to be pretty bland and boring... this is because you are looking at the default, pretty much unstyled versions of components.\nThere are two concepts involved with design and token application in\n**kickstartDS**: Branding Token: Small set of expressive values to seed your initial Design Tokenset Design Token: Managed Style Dictionarycontaining your semantic Design Tokenset **Branding Token** are set in\nsrc/token/branding-token.json, while your\n**Design Token** set lives at\nsrc/token/dictionary. Initialization of token happens through\nyarn init-tokens, while compiling your\n**Design Token** set to **Component Token** (among other formats) is done by running\nyarn build-tokens.\n**Component Token** are the third type of token involved, but those only come into play later. They are not concerned with the general styling / theming of your **Design System**, but rather map your **Design Token** set to components in a layered way.\nTo learn more about this process, follow the section \"2. Design Application\" of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\n### Adding components\nAs described in the intro to this\nREADME, the components already included serve as a great example on how to leverage\n**kickstartDS**. But obviously you will want to add your own components, suited to exactly your needs!\nWe have to tried to outline this process of component creation, and all its aspects, in our documentation. All the components included with this starter get created in part of \"4. Add Components\" of our main guide \"Create your Design System\". You can use that guide to cross-reference the thought process behind the components already included, and it should give you a good idea on how to approach your own ones.\nYou can have a look at all the component examples in our guides here, or learn about the involved processes in more detail in the \"Components\" subsection.\nFuther, all the aspects making up a component are described as part of the \"Component\" subsection under \"Foundations\".\nIf unsure on what components you actually need, or which ones to tackle first, you could investigate starting your own Design System Initiative. We also wrote about it in a blog post, and offer support in executing one... if you still feel like you need a helping hand!\n### Dig into our docs\nWe have added a lot of links to specific docs sections in all the other paragraphs already. But they deserve a special mention here. Creating a\n**Design System** can be both highly custom and opinionated. This is why we think explaining our reasoning in detail, especially when we take decisions for you (like using **Style Dictionary**), is super important. And for areas where there is no clear cut decision to take, we always try to add recommendations (like how to best construct your components to avoid adding technical debt) instead.\nSome quick links to get you started:\n|Link||Description|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/||Start page, good intro to the general structure of our docs|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/intro/||Super general introduction of |kickstartDS, including YouTube explanation\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/foundations/||Foundational info about the structure and architecture of |kickstartDS\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/integration/||Info about the ways |kickstartDS integrates with other tooling and systems\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/||Focused guides, categorized into the main areas of a |Design System\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/create/||Main guide, also a great reference for the reasoning behind this starter|\n|https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/feedback/||All the ways you can provide feedback to us, which we value a lot!|\n## Features\nThis starter is already quite rich in features that are enabled out-of-the-box for you. To give you some orientation, while also describing the intention behind features, and ensuring you can actually make the most out of your\n**Design System**.\n**Design Token** integration\nOne important part of a\n**Design System** is having a well structured and semantic token system in place. Learn about customizing your **Design Token** set in our dedicated section above, helping you to adapt your own branding / CI / CD. **Design Token** can be initialized by changing the values in\nsrc/token/branding-token.json and calling\nyarn init-tokens, and compiled to\n**CSS Custom Properties** by running\nyarn build-tokens. While\nyarn init-tokens generates your\n**Design Token** set in\nsrc/token/dictionary,\nyarn build-tokens reads it from there, and outputs the resulting formats (which\n**CSS Custom Properties** is just one of) according to your **Style Dictionary** config.\nWe already include a minimal\n**Style Dictionary** configuration as part of our **CLI**, but you can overwrite this configuration by adding a\nsd.config.cjs to your repository root. Explore that file for details on the formats configured in this starter (the path the format output is written to can be influenced by setting\nbuildPath):\n|Platform||Description|\ncss |Creates a |Design Token converted to CSS Custom Properties, using the naming structure expected by Component Token in\nhtml HTML icon sprite (learn more), that is needed when integrating raw HTML (e.g. into PHP, ASP.NET, or similar). Also serves as the central icon file read by the storybook-design-token addon. Added as\njsx React version of the same file as the one above, this should be used when working with React directly. Called\nstorybook |Writes a selection of files (|storybook-design-token addon\njs |This also creates a file (|Storybook, to add some light theming to your instance based on your Design Token set.\nAlso included is a set of\n**Storybook** pages documenting your **Design Token** set, using aforementioned **storybook-design-token** addon. You can find them in\ndocs/tokens, feel free to adjust them to your liking!\nYou can also have a look at our\n**Figma** token file visualizing exactly that token structure:\nTo learn more about\n**Design Token** and their support in **kickstartDS** read our first release spotlight: Release Spotlight: Semantic Token.\n**Storybook** integration\nSome aspects of our integration with\n**Storybook** were already covered by the last section about **Design Token** integration. But let's quickly outline **all** of the integration points:\n|Integration||Description|\nJSON Schema Storybook addon written by us, to display your component API directly alongside your component (includes inline JSON editor using Monaco, with auto-complete).\nDesign Token |Integration with |storybook-design-token addon, read more about it on our integration page about it. Also included are Storybook pages documenting your Design Token set... you can find them in\nComponent Token |Another |Storybook addon we made. Visualizes your layered Component Token, and enables changing values interactively. Changed values get stored in session storage, allowing you to test them throughout your whole Design System.\nGenerated Controls |Your component API (|JSON Schema files defining your components structure) get converted to Storybook Controls automatically. Learn more about this zero-config setup in our dedicated integrations page about it.\nPremade Stories |Especially when adapting components closely, you can benefit from our |Storybook exports. We take great care to export everything (parameters, variants, general setup) for you to re-use while writing your own Stories.\nTheming |Finally some light theming gets applied to your |Storybook instance, based on your Design Token set. It should be subdued, but making Storybook your own really helps in establishing a sense of ownership!\nComposition |As part of the left sidebar you have a section titled |kickstartDS uses Storybook composition to always include the base documentation (in the correct version used by your Design System) to your Storybook. **Design Token** get compiled using the **kickstartDS CLI** as part of your\npackage.json. This converts your\n**Style Dictionary** from\nsrc/token/dictionary into all the formats configured in\nsd.config.cjs.\n**Storybook** is configured to import our special, annotated\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.css (this one includes presenters for\n**storybook-design-token**) through the import of the compiled\nmanager.css.\n**Theming** is done in\n.storybook/themes.js, and works by importing our tokens (generated with their own special\n**Style Dictionary** format). Those then just get connected into the **Storybook** theme structure in a sensible way.\nAll the other integrations don't live at\n**one** central place, but instead require configuration per component / **Story**. So lets look at an example in the\nButton component instead:\nJSON Schemaintegration for the\nButton, loading the dereferenced schema, setting it as a\nStoryparameter, and using the\npackhelper throughout\nButton.stories.jsx. The rest is handled by our\nStorybook JSON Schema Addon. Component Tokenare integrated by importing the generated\nbutton-tokens.json, and then passing that as a parameter to the\nStory. Generation of those files per component is done in\npackage.jsonhere. The rest is handled again by our own addon:\nStorybook Component Tokens Addon. Generated Controlsare enabled by importing the helpers\ngetArgsSharedand\npack, and using them throughout the\nStory. This takes care of generating all the Storybook Controlsautomatically for you, based off your component APIs (the JSON Schemadefinitions). Premade storieswork by importing the base Storyfirst, and then destructuring it into the default export... before setting your own options as overrides.\n**React** integration\nThere are some\n**React** concepts already in use deep in **kickstartDS**, and its base components you build upon. This includes using **Render Props** and adding **Context** / **Provider** to all components, both to enable flexible and efficient mix-and-match of components.\nYou can see some examples on how this can be applied in our docs about it. Those concepts also get used throughout our main guide \"Create your Design System\", for example when adding RTE-rendering to the\nHeadline. All components included in this starter are the result of example guides.\nThis also easily enables more advanced integrations for your components to offer, later on. For example, when integrating with a headless CMS like\n**Sanity**, and using existing **Render Props** to turn our default **Markdown** capable\nRichText component to one specific to\n**Sanity**, using\nPortableText.\nFor this starter this means having a file\nsrc/Providers.jsx in place, that includes all the needed\nProviders to replace the base components by their customized versions throughout your whole\n**Design System**. As we've added our own versions of the\nButton,\nTeaserBox and\nSection components in this starter, those are imported and added. We also support\n**Bedrock Layout Primitives** out-of-the-box, so that provider gets added, too. You can read more about the\nProvider setup in one of our guides here.\nProviders need to be set for\n**Storybook**, both for previews and the\nDocs container to render components properly. This, too, is covered by our main guide here.\n##### When you need Providers\nWhen you're building a page or application using\n**React**, you will need to\nadd those\nProviders to your central layout there!\n**Bedrock Layout Primitives** integration\nFor the most common use cases we include the\nSection component with\n**kickstartDS**, and it's adapted for this **Design System** starter, too. It even includes some customizations here, as described in our component example guide \"Extend\nSection component`.\nThe\nSection component is especially well suited for marketing and landing pages. It provdides general layout options (\"horizontal slices\" on a page) for components to be put in. You can see all available options here:\n**Storybook** Docs for\nSection.\nWe also cover the\nSection, and some example uses, in more detail in our \"Layout\" section of the docs.\nWhen you have more general layout needs, not covered by simply using a\nSection component, we usually recommend using\n**Bedrock Layout Primitives** for those cases. We think it meshes really well with our approach to **Design Token**, you simply connect your existing **Design Token** set to their theming approach. We already provide such an integration with this starter. You can read about this combination in more detail on our \"Foundations\" page about **Bedrock Layout Primitives**.\nTo learn more about\n**Bedrock Layout Primitves** and why, when and how to use it with **kickstartDS**, and when **Container Queries** might actually be preferrable, you can also read our second release spotlight: Release Spotlight: Container Queries.\n**Playroom** integration\nWe're big proponents of prototyping interface as close to your real\n**Design System** as possible. For developers, and even code-affine designers, we really love the DX **Playroom** by seek-oss offers for this.\nThis is why we've included a\n**Playroom** integration with this starter (and because it's actually really easy to do with the way **kickstartDS** is set up) at\nplayroom.config.js.\nThere's some configuration in\n**Storybook**s\n.storybook/preview.js, and all components that should be enabled need to be added in\nsrc/playroom/components.ts. We also added\n**Bedrock Layout Primitives** support out-of-the-box, there.\nTo change the included\n**Snippets** edit\nsrc/playroom/snippets.ts, and to change the theme integration (or even to add multiple themes / white-label testing capabilities to it) have a look at\nsrc/playroom/FrameComponent.tsx and the folder\nsrc/playroom/themes.\nFinally,\n**TypeScript** support for all your (and our **kickstartDS** base) components is also already configured. This enables auto-complete for all components, making it really easy and playful to discover components and their properties!\nStart your\n**Playroom**:\n_1yarn playroom\n##### Combined use with Storybook\nYou can even use\n**Playroom** in your\n**Storybook** as\nan addon, just be sure start **Playroom** before starting **Storybook**.\nBecause you guessed it: it's already set up!\n### Bundling\nWith this starter we want to cover the complete life-cycle of a\n**Design System**. This includes **Bundling** and **Release handling**. We also want to show what we mean when we say **kickstartDS** is framework-agnostic.\nBecause you can either use a\n**Design System** based on **kickstartDS** by working with **React** templates directly, or by alternatively using **CSS** and **JavaScript** bundles to be used with the raw markup generated by components... both cases are covered in this starter.\nIt's also quite common for both types of usage to coexist for your\n**Design System**. Your main marketing page might be built with a headless CMS and a modern stack using **React**, while some arcane internal tooling might still use **PHP** for its templating. This setup enables you to serve both!\nAll bundling is handled by the\ndist:* tasks in\npackage.json.\n#### Bundling for\n**HTML** usage **CSS** bundling with **Dart Sass** is done by the\ndist:sass script in\npackage.json. Just be sure to add all needed component\n**CSS** to\nsrc/dist.scss, the compiled output will live at\ndist/index.css.\n**JavaScript** bundling with **esbuild** is done by the\ndist:js script in\npackage.json. As with\n**CSS**, be sure to add all needed component **JavaScript** to\nsrc/dist.js, the compiled output will live at\ndist/index.js.\nNext to all that configuration, as a start the included \"Integration\"\n**Story** describes this process to potential developers using your **Design System** this way.\n#### Bundling for\n**React** usage\nConsumable\n**React** component versions are bundled by\ndist:components in\npackage.json. This also uses\n**esbuild** under the hood, for details about its implementation see\nscripts/bundleComponents.js.\n### Release handling\nRelease handling for this starter is configured to use\n**auto**, and its semantic versioning. We use this setup for **kickstartDS** itself, you can learn more about it in our documentation.\nConfiguration is added in\n.autorc, and if you want to enable releases as part of your\n**CI** / **CD**... you can use **Circle CI** with the included configuration file at\n.circleci/config.yml.\nWe will probably expand on this section, when we have a better picture of everyones setup and needs!\n##### Visual Regression Testing with Chromatic\nOne of the relatively undocumented features is\n**Visual Regression\nTesting**\nwith **Chromatic**. This is prepared to be\nusable with\nyarn chromatic\n(also compatible with\n**CI** / **CD**) in\npackage.json.\n## Content\nWe've described all the features extensively now. To wrap up this\n**README** let's quickly summarize everything included from a \"content\" perspective: **Components**, **Pages**, **Recipes** and **Docs**.\n### Components\nAs described in the very intro to this\n**README**, all the included components should be immediately useful in pretty much every **Design System**, but they're also specifically used to showcase features and best practices at play in **kickstartDS**, and to make it easier for you to just add stuff to an already working, well-oiled system:\n### Recipes\nWe added one recipe to give you an idea on how you could use those. We've added an\nArticleTeaser recipe, as one entry in the more general\nArticle recipe category.\nRecipes are useful to show how your existing components can be re-used, re-mixed and re-applied to new use cases, avoiding the creation of many specialized components. They serve as great inspiration for consumers of your\n**Design System**, while also slightly nudging in a certain direction by the examples you decide to showcase!\n### Pages\nThere is one\n**Page** currently included with this starter in\nsrc/pages/Demo.story.jsx, added to\n**Storybook** by\nsrc/pages/Pages.stories.jsx.\n### Docs\nThere are two docs pages (the\n**Welcome** page and the **Integration** page), and documentation for all token from your **Design Token** set, included with this starter. Feel free to add further docs pages to your **Design System** in\ndocs/.\n## Scripts\nShort descriptions for all of the scripts entries in\npackage.json:\n|Script||Link||Description|\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Compile |Design Token set first, run\n|Features > |Design Token integration |Compile |Design Token set according to\n|Features > Release handling||Run |Visual Regression Tests with Chromatic\n|Features > Bundling > Bundling for |React usage |Build all the components for |React usage\n|Features > Bundling||Copy |\n|Features > Bundling > Bundling for |React usage |Copy |\n|Features > Bundling||Copy |\n|Features > Bundling||copy |\n|Features > Bundling > Bundling for |HTML usage |Build |CSS using Dart Sass\n|Features > Bundling||Process |JSON Schema files, copy result to TypeScript types\n|Features > Bundling||Build component |JavaScript using esbuild\n|Next steps > Customizing |Design Token |Initialize |Design Token set using\n|Features > |Playroom integration |Start all watch tasks before starting |Playroom\n|Features > |Playroom integration |Starts |Playroom in watch mode\n|Features > |Playroom integration |Builds |Playroom for deployment\n|Features > Release handling||Runs before publishing a release, resets |Design Token set and then runs all\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Compile |CSS for use in Storybook (when not bundled for distribution)\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Compile |CSS for Storybooks manager, enables the light theming capabilities added\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Run all the |\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Dereference |JSON Schema, to inline all references ( Storybook Controls) easier\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Generate |TypeScript types based on your component API\n|Getting started (in 5 minutes)||Start everything in watch mode, and then start |Storybook in watch mode, too\n|Getting started (in 5 minutes)||Alias for default |Storybook start script\n|Features > |Design Token integration |Extracts |Component Token from component CSS / SCSS, so they can be displayed in our addon\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Compile |CSS for use in Storybook in watch mode\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Compile |CSS for Storybooks manager in watch mode\n|Features > |Storybook integration |Run all the schema scripts in parallel, when a |JSON Schema changes\n|Features > |Design Token integration |Compile |Design Token set and extract Component Token when a tokens CSS / SCSS file changes\n|Features > |Design Token integration |Compile |Design Token set when a Style Dictionary file changes"}, "lines": ["# kickstartDS Design System Starter", "## About", "The", "**kickstartDS Design System Starter** is your most efficient way of kickstarting a **Design System**.

Component Definition\nPurpose\nWe've found that we'd love to use the existing kickstartDSSection, but it's not quite flexible enough for our taste. We'd like to add more call-to-actions to our page, which mostly consists of such Sections, and don't need as much flexibility for the included headline.\nWe take width, gutter, mode, content, spaceBefore, spaceAfter and inverted directly from the Section, and rename background to style for our version of it. And crucially we add our own property ctas, to hold call-to-actions, into the mix, while reducing the complexity of headline significantly... from mapping to all of the Headline properties, to just a single string type prop setting its content.\nWe also keep the name Section, as it fits our use case well enough already.\nStructure\nDefining the structure of a component means finding the component API for it:\nProperty\nType\nDescription\nheadline\nstring\nHeadline for the section\nwidth\nenum\nWidth of section to use\ngutter\nenum\nSize of gutter to use\nmode\nenum\nLayout mode used for section contents\ncontent\narray\nAllowed content for the section\nstyle\nenum\nStyle of section, influences background\nspaceBefore\nenum\nAmount of spacing before the section\nspaceAfter\nenum\nAmount of spacing after the section\ninverted\nboolean\nWhether to invert the section\nctas\narray\nCall-to-actions to show\nctas[].label *\nstring\nLabel for the Call to action\nctas[].target *\nstring\nTarget for the Call to action\nFields that should be required are marked with a *.\nWhile directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our JSON Schema later!\n2. Component Creation\nWe like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (.jsx / .tsx), potential CSS / SASS (.css / .scss), JavaScript (.js / .ts), our JSON Schema component definition (.schema.json), and so on.\nSo we start by creating the directory src/components/section, from our Design System repository root:\n_1\nmkdir -p src/components/section\nThis is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.\nJSON Schema definition\nFirst file we'll create is the JSON Schema definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:\nFinished JSON Schema\nWe'll work our way up to this JSON Schema definition.\nWe start by adding a title, description and $id attribute.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nsrc/components/section/SectionProps.ts\nsrc/components/section/section.schema.json\n_176\n/* eslint-disable */\n_176\n/**\n_176\n* This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.\n_176\n* DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,\n_176\n* and runyarn run schema` to regenerate this file.\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional React component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the JSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the kickstartDSStorytelling component.\nFinished React template\nWe'll work our way up to this React template.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_61\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC, PropsWithChildren } from \"react\";\n_61\n_61\nimport {\n_61\nSectionContextDefault,\n_61\nSectionContext,\n_61\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_61\n_61\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_61\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nImport and add generated props from SectionProps.ts. Generated by our JSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add HTMLAttributes to the type signature for the props that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure props. We add our default values here, too. We'll just pass through everything HTMLAttributes related!\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_20\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_20\n_20\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_20\n_20\nexport const Section: FC<\n_20\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes\n_20\n\n= ({\n_20\nheadline,\n_20\nwidth = \"default\",\n_20\ngutter = \"default\",\n_20\nmode = \"default\",\n_20\nstyle = \"default\",\n_20\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_20\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_20\ninverted = false,\n_20\nctas = [],\n_20\n...props\n_20\n}) => (\n_20\n\nLorem ipsum\n_20\n));\nAdd Section component 1/7\nNow we'll import and add the kickstartDSSection component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the Content BoxesSection variant from our kickstartDS Design System.\nWe'll omit the child components added there (ContentBoxes), as they only exist for illustrative purposes inside that Storybook. We will just pass children through to the original Section, later.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_43\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_43\n_43\nimport {\n_43\nSectionContextDefault,\n_43\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_43\n_43\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_43\n_43\nexport const Section: FC<\n_43\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes\n_43\n\n= ({\n_43\nheadline,\n_43\nwidth = \"default\",\n_43\ngutter = \"default\",\n_43\nmode = \"default\",\n_43\nstyle = \"default\",\n_43\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_43\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_43\ninverted = false,\n_43\nctas = [],\n_43\n...props\n_43\n}) => (\n_43\n\n_43\n));\nAdd Section component 2/7\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values undefined or null in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the default value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_34\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_34\n_34\nimport {\n_34\nSectionContextDefault,\n_34\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_34\n_34\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_34\n_34\nexport const Section: FC<\n_34\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes\n_34\n= ({\n_34\nheadline,\n_34\nwidth = \"default\",\n_34\ngutter = \"default\",\n_34\nmode = \"default\",\n_34\nstyle = \"default\",\n_34\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_34\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_34\ninverted = false,\n_34\nctas = [],\n_34\n...props\n_34\n}) => (\n_34\n\n_34\n));\nAdd Section component 3/7\nWe now import the component we want to use to display the call-to-actions, in this case a Button included in our own Design System. We also add a second Section (losing its headline) to hold our Buttons, and connect those to cta.label. We choose the variant of Button by index, first equals primary, second means secondary and all others are tertiary.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_51\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_51\n_51\nimport {\n_51\nSectionContextDefault,\n_51\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_51\n_51\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_51\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying kickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure props first, so our own properties take precedence when set. We add it to the first Section, that will always be rendered.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_56\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_56\n_56\nimport { SectionContextDefault } from '@kickstartds/base/lib/section';\n_56\n_56\nimport { SectionProps } from './SectionProps';\n_56\nimport { Button } from '../button/ButtonComponent';\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our React component. We're using TypeScript here (.tsx), but it works the same with plain JSX (.jsx).\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from SectionProps.ts. Generated by our JSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add HTMLAttributes to the type signature for the props that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\nDestructure props\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure props. We add our default values here, too. We'll just pass through everything HTMLAttributes related!\nAdd Section component 1/7\nNow we'll import and add the kickstartDSSection component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the Content BoxesSection variant from our kickstartDS Design System.\nWe'll omit the child components added there (ContentBoxes), as they only exist for illustrative purposes inside that Storybook.

Those can be freely removed.\nAdd Section component 3/7\nWe now import the component we want to use to display the call-to-actions, in this case a Button included in our own Design System. We also add a second Section (losing its headline) to hold our Buttons, and connect those to cta.label. We choose the variant of Button by index, first equals primary, second means secondary and all others are tertiary.\nAdd Section component 4/7\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying kickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure props first, so our own properties take precedence when set. We add it to the first Section, that will always be rendered.\nAdd Section component 5/7\nWe renamed background to style in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form... to both Sections.\nAdd Section component 6/7\nWe connect our property headline to the first Sections headline.content.\nAdd Section component 7/7\nAs a final step, we make sure the spacing between the two Sections is optimized, so it will look seamless later on. We also hard code some options of the second Section.\nAdd component Provider\nWe want our Section to replace all default kickstartDS base Sections, no matter where they appear. We add a Provider for that purpose now!\nFinished React template\nLet's have a look at our completed React template.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_61\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC, PropsWithChildren } from \"react\";\n_61\n_61\nimport {\n_61\nSectionContextDefault,\n_61\nSectionContext,\n_61\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_61\n_61\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_61\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nTo complete the template we add the SectionProvider to our src/components/Providers.jsx:\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx\n_14\nimport { ButtonProvider } from \"./button/ButtonComponent\";\n_14\nimport { SectionProvider } from \"./section/SectionComponent\";\n_14\nimport { TeaserBoxProvider } from \"./teaser-card/TeaserCardComponent\";\n_14\nimport { HeadlineProvider } from \"./headline/HeadlineComponent\";\n_14\n_14\nexport default (props) => (\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n\n_14\n);\nThis concludes the creation of our new Section component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\nUse of Storybook\nIf you're using Storybook, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with kickstartDS!\nStorybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your\nDesign System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and\nconfiguration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your src/components/section folder:\nImport re-usable SectionStories\nImport Section component and add it to the Template that we'll bind Stories to.\nImport re-usable TeaserCardStories\nImport TeaserCardStories as demo content for our SectionStory. Add them to the Template, too.\nImport Storybook Controls helpers\nImport dereferenced component JSON Schema and getArgsShared helper to generate Storybook Controls, and parameterize Storybook JSON Schema Addon.\nOverwrite Story values where needed\nWe set all the Story defaults specific to our component.\nConvert args to flat keys\nWe use pack to convert all deep JSON args to flat (. delimited) keys and values.

When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:\nsrc/components/section/SectionProps.ts\nsrc/components/section/section.schema.json\n_176\n/* eslint-disable */\n_176\n/**\n_176\n* This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.\n_176\n* DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,\n_176\n* and run `yarn run schema` to regenerate this file.\nAs the final step for this example, we'll add the template. This will be a purely functional React component, mapping our component structure (as defined in the JSON Schema) to the original component we're basing our work off of; the kickstartDSStorytelling component.\nFinished React template\nWe'll work our way up to this React template.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_61\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC, PropsWithChildren } from \"react\";\n_61\n_61\nimport {\n_61\nSectionContextDefault,\n_61\nSectionContext,\n_61\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_61\n_61\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_61\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nImport and add generated props from SectionProps.ts. Generated by our JSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> to the type signature for the props that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure props. We add our default values here, too. We'll just pass through everything HTMLAttributes related!\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_20\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_20\n_20\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_20\n_20\nexport const Section: FC<\n_20\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>\n_20\n> = ({\n_20\nheadline,\n_20\nwidth = \"default\",\n_20\ngutter = \"default\",\n_20\nmode = \"default\",\n_20\nstyle = \"default\",\n_20\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_20\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_20\ninverted = false,\n_20\nctas = [],\n_20\n...props\n_20\n}) => (\n_20\n<div {...props}>Lorem ipsum</div>\n_20\n));\nAdd Section component 1/7\nNow we'll import and add the kickstartDSSection component. To start, we'll use the hard-coded properties of the Content BoxesSection variant from our kickstartDS Design System.\nWe'll omit the child components added there (ContentBoxes), as they only exist for illustrative purposes inside that Storybook. We will just pass children through to the original Section, later.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_43\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_43\n_43\nimport {\n_43\nSectionContextDefault,\n_43\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_43\n_43\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_43\n_43\nexport const Section: FC<\n_43\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>\n_43\n> = ({\n_43\nheadline,\n_43\nwidth = \"default\",\n_43\ngutter = \"default\",\n_43\nmode = \"default\",\n_43\nstyle = \"default\",\n_43\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_43\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_43\ninverted = false,\n_43\nctas = [],\n_43\n...props\n_43\n}) => (\n_43\n<SectionContextDefault\n_43\nbackground=\"default\"\n_43\nheadline={{\n_43\nalign: 'center',\n_43\nclassName: undefined,\n_43\ncontent: 'Headline',\n_43\nlevel: 'h2',\n_43\npageHeader: false,\n_43\nspaceAfter: 'none',\n_43\nstyleAs: 'none',\n_43\nsubheadline: undefined\n_43\n}}\n_43\nwidth=\"default\"\n_43\ngutter=\"default\"\n_43\nmode=\"tile\"\n_43\npattern=\"none\"\n_43\nspaceBefore=\"default\"\n_43\nspaceAfter=\"default\"\n_43\nvariant=\"none\"\n_43\n/>\n_43\n));\nAdd Section component 2/7\nWe remove all of the unneeded stuff, as there are a bunch of properties that are completely optional, mainly those having their values undefined or null in the copied JSX, or ones which just state the default value of that property anyway. Those can be freely removed.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_34\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_34\n_34\nimport {\n_34\nSectionContextDefault,\n_34\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_34\n_34\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_34\n_34\nexport const Section: FC<\n_34\nSectionProps & HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>\n_34\n> = ({\n_34\nheadline,\n_34\nwidth = \"default\",\n_34\ngutter = \"default\",\n_34\nmode = \"default\",\n_34\nstyle = \"default\",\n_34\nspaceBefore = \"default\",\n_34\nspaceAfter = \"default\",\n_34\ninverted = false,\n_34\nctas = [],\n_34\n...props\n_34\n}) => (\n_34\n<SectionContextDefault\n_34\nbackground=\"default\"\n_34\nheadline={{\n_34\ncontent: 'Headline',\n_34\n}}\n_34\nwidth=\"default\"\n_34\ngutter=\"default\"\n_34\nmode=\"tile\"\n_34\nspaceBefore=\"default\"\n_34\nspaceAfter=\"default\"\n_34\n/>\n_34\n));\nAdd Section component 3/7\nWe now import the component we want to use to display the call-to-actions, in this case a Button included in our own Design System. We also add a second Section (losing its headline) to hold our Buttons, and connect those to cta.label. We choose the variant of Button by index, first equals primary, second means secondary and all others are tertiary.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_51\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_51\n_51\nimport {\n_51\nSectionContextDefault,\n_51\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_51\n_51\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_51\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying kickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure props first, so our own properties take precedence when set. We add it to the first Section, that will always be rendered.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_56\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC } from \"react\";\n_56\n_56\nimport { SectionContextDefault } from '@kickstartds/base/lib/section';\n_56\n_56\nimport { SectionProps } from './SectionProps';\n_56\nimport { Button } from '../button/ButtonComponent';\nAgain we'll start with a very basic skeleton for our React component. We're using TypeScript here (.tsx), but it works the same with plain JSX (.jsx).\nAdd correct typings\nImport and add generated props from SectionProps.ts. Generated by our JSON Schema, these guarantee you're matching your expected component structure while implementing. In combination with TypeScript this enables auto-complete and auto-fix for even better DX! (see here, at the very end of that section, for more details)\nWe also add HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> to the type signature for the props that we'll pass through to the native HTML element underneath.\nDestructure props\nWe also need to add our own properties, so we'll destructure props.

We also add a second Section (losing its headline) to hold our Buttons, and connect those to cta.label. We choose the variant of Button by index, first equals primary, second means secondary and all others are tertiary.\nAdd Section component 4/7\nWe then connect the props as defined in our component API that are directly taken from the underlying kickstartDS base component by just passing them through. We also destructure props first, so our own properties take precedence when set. We add it to the first Section, that will always be rendered.\nAdd Section component 5/7\nWe renamed background to style in our component API, so we add that in its renamed form... to both Sections.\nAdd Section component 6/7\nWe connect our property headline to the first Sections headline.content.\nAdd Section component 7/7\nAs a final step, we make sure the spacing between the two Sections is optimized, so it will look seamless later on. We also hard code some options of the second Section.\nAdd component Provider\nWe want our Section to replace all default kickstartDS base Sections, no matter where they appear. We add a Provider for that purpose now!\nFinished React template\nLet's have a look at our completed React template.\nsrc/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx\n_61\nimport { HTMLAttributes, FC, PropsWithChildren } from \"react\";\n_61\n_61\nimport {\n_61\nSectionContextDefault,\n_61\nSectionContext,\n_61\n} from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/section\";\n_61\n_61\nimport { SectionProps } from \"./SectionProps\";\n_61\nimport { Button } from \"../button/ButtonComponent\";\nTo complete the template we add the SectionProvider to our src/components/Providers.jsx:\nsrc/components/Providers.jsx\n_14\nimport { ButtonProvider } from \"./button/ButtonComponent\";\n_14\nimport { SectionProvider } from \"./section/SectionComponent\";\n_14\nimport { TeaserBoxProvider } from \"./teaser-card/TeaserCardComponent\";\n_14\nimport { HeadlineProvider } from \"./headline/HeadlineComponent\";\n_14\n_14\nexport default (props) => (\n_14\n<ButtonProvider>\n_14\n<HeadlineProvider>\n_14\n<SectionProvider>\n_14\n<TeaserBoxProvider {...props} />\n_14\n</SectionProvider>\n_14\n</HeadlineProvider>\n_14\n</ButtonProvider>\n_14\n);\nThis concludes the creation of our new Section component. It's now ready to be used inside your Design System, and available to your down stream consumers... hopefully efficiently closing a gap for them!\nUse of Storybook\nIf you're using Storybook, you can follow this part of the example to get all the integration goodness possible with kickstartDS!\nStorybook setup\nThis guide assumes you're using a set up like described in our Create your\nDesign System guide! Be sure to adapt commands and\nconfiguration to your use accordingly, when following this part!\nAdd the following file to your src/components/section folder:\nImport re-usable SectionStories\nImport Section component and add it to the Template that we'll bind Stories to.\nImport re-usable TeaserCardStories\nImport TeaserCardStories as demo content for our SectionStory. Add them to the Template, too.\nImport Storybook Controls helpers\nImport dereferenced component JSON Schema and getArgsShared helper to generate Storybook Controls, and parameterize Storybook JSON Schema Addon.\nOverwrite Story values where needed\nWe set all the Story defaults specific to our component.\nConvert args to flat keys\nWe use pack to convert all deep JSON args to flat (. delimited) keys and values.

Design Application\nOverview\nApplying your branding and corporate design to\nkickstartDS is itself done in roughly two steps:\n- Use a reduced set of\nBranding Tokento generate your initial Design Tokenset\n- Fine tune the resulting\nDesign Tokenset to closely fit your corporate identity\nApply branding\nInitialization\nWe start by creating a file\nbranding-token.json, inside a new directory\nsrc/token... for everything to do with\nDesign Token going forward:\n_2mkdir -p src/token_2touch src/token/branding-token.json\nThis file will hold all of our\nBranding Token. Those are used to initialize you first Design Token set, and especially ease first-time setup.\nGet the most up-to-date version of its content from here, and paste it into the file you just created:\nUse a current version\nBe sure to actually copy the file linked above, entering the values yourself. This way you'll be sure not to miss any recently updated token in your set up, in case this guide gets outdated!\nSelect\nBranding Token\nFor a more in-depth overview of those token, have a look at our foundations page about\nBranding Token, detailing all values in use.\nBut to get a first feel for working with the file, and to add some flavour to our Design System, we'll change some select values around. And feel free to replace everything with values that seem more appropriate for you, or that fit your particular brand (maybe even because you opted to follow the more detailed guide above). If you're wondering which values we selected for this guide... we're mostly matching our own brand for this guide:\n|Preview||Name||Value|\nApply\nBranding Token\nSo let's get right into it, customizing step by step:\nStart with copied\nbranding-token.json\nThis is the file you've copied before, we'll start updating it piecemeal to show off common ways of design application.\nCustomize\nprimary color\nMost brands have such a\nprimary color as part of their corporate design guidelines. This will be used to highlight elements, and give them more importance.\nNext to\nprimary itself, we'll also define its counter part\nprimary-inverted as\necff00 (\nfff /\nwhite works for most uses otherwise, read about the finer details here).\nCustomize\nforeground and\nlink colors\nFor this guide we'll have just change the\nforeground color, but this will influence how elements and text are rendered in components. So it is quite an influential choice.\nAdditionally we'll define some slightly different colors for our\nlink and\nlink-inverted (they always come in pairs!), to make it unique.\nCustomize tonal colors\nThere are a bunch of tokens that, for lack of a better explanation, relate to the tone of voice the element using it should have. Most commonly this would be something like a notice shown to the user (which might be successful = positive, neutral = informative, etc).\nBecause it seems to fit our branding, and doesn't interfere with user expectations otherwise, we'll change\ninformative (and you guessed it,\ninformative-inverted) to our\nprimary color.\nAdd a fitting font\nIn this guide we'll opt for a native system font stack for our\ndisplay and\ncopy fonts. We'll leave\ninterface and\nmono and all size values untouched for now. If you have other requirements (for example a self-hosted font, or one by Google Fonts), we'll add a guide for that soon!\nAdjust spacing behaviour\nAs we have a pretty dense layout in mind, we reduce\nspacing >\nscale-ratio and\nbp-ratio a bit. This will result in spacing in general scaling a bit less.\nWe keep the general spacing of\n8px, though. We'll also leave the rest of the values untouched as they'll work just fine for this guide!\nStart with copied\nbranding-token.json\nThis is the file you've copied before, we'll start updating it piecemeal to show off common ways of design application.\nCustomize\nprimary color\nMost brands have such a\nprimary color as part of their corporate design guidelines.

We'll also leave the rest of the values untouched as they'll work just fine for this guide!\nNow that we have a slightly modified, up-to-date version of our\nBranding Token in place, we can start hooking everything up.\nkickstartDS Integration\nFirst, add the\nkickstartDS CLI to your project:\n_1yarn add kickstartds\nRead more about our CLI here\nThen add the following two additional lines to your\npackage.json scripts block:\ninit-tokens is used to convert your\nBranding Token (\nbranding-token.json) into a\nStyle Dictionary compatible Design Token set (a bunch of\nJSON files), whereas\nbuild-tokens takes your\nDesign Token set, and converts it to the outputs needed to use and display your Design System. But more about this later!\nGenerate first\nDesign Token set\nGenerate your first full set of\nDesign Token now, by calling:\n1yarn init-tokens\nYour output should look roughly like this:\n_35yarn run v1.22.18_35$ kickstartDS tokens init_35 _  _  _ 35| | (_) | | _| |_  _  __| || _ \\/ |35| |/ / |/ | |/ / | __/ ` | '| | | | _ _35| <| | (| <_ \\ || (| | | | || || |) |35||__|_||____/__,|| _|/|_/35_35__/\\\\\\\\__/\\___/\\\\\\\\\\__35_/\\\\////////__\\/\\_____________\\/////\\\\///_________35_________/\\\\/___________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________35________/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________35_______\\/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________35_______\\//\\____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________35________\\///\\__________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________35__/\\____\\////\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\_/\\__35\\///__\\/////////\\///////////////\\///////////__\\///___35_35Version: 1.0.0_35For more information visit:_35https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_35_35Starting..._35[kickstartDS: general] info: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_35[kickstartDS: tokens/init] starting: init command with init variable init-task_35[1/1] [init: check] info: checking prerequesites before starting_35[1/1] [init: check] info: prerequesites met, starting_35[init: cleanup] info: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-init-init-task before starting command_35[init: cleanup] info: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-init-init-task before starting command_35[1/1] [init: init] info: running the init subtask_35[info] generating your token set from primitives tokens file /tmp/tokens-init-init-task/token-primitives.json_35[info] successfully generated primitives tokens and wrote them to folder /tmp/tokens-init-init-task/./src/token/dictionary_35[1/1] [init: init] info: finished running the init subtask successfully_35[kickstartDS: tokens/init] finished: init command with init variable init-task_35Done in 1.19s.\nIt uses your\nbranding-token.json as an input, and generates a folder\nsrc/token/dictionary for you.

It's meant to specifically ease this workflow. Running it again will overwrite changes you manually did to your\nDesign Token set, which is probably not intended!\nTo learn more about the categories represented by those generated files, have a look at our foundations page about them.\nCompile\nDesign Token set\nFinally, to test the integration works as expected, we'll first want to create one additional file:\nsd.config.cjs at our projects root. As the name may imply, this is further configuration for our\nDesign Token, to convert them into different outputs (more specifically the Style Dictionary that gets used under the hood):\nAnd, as this is based on\nStyle Dictionary, it generally follows their configuration scheme.\nLet's detail some lines:\nImport dependencies\nImport\nstyle-dictionary to use their native\nStyleDictionary.extend, and get our pre-made,\nkickstartDS compatible, configuration from\n@kickstartds/style-dictionary.\nExtend configuration\nOur pre-made configuration gets extended by our local project setup. That way we can reuse stuff for easier configuration, if needed.\nDesign Token location\nWe configure the default\nDesign Token location, which is\ntokens as a glob\nsrc/token/dictionary/*/.json...\nDefault SVG icons\n... and tell\nStyle Dictionary where to look for our default icons. These are used by kickstartDS components, and need to be present in different formats later on (depending on the use case).\nPlatforms\nTo test that our integration works as expected, we'll add the\nCSS platform for now, which will result in our Design Token being converted to CSS custom properties, as\nsrc/token/tokens.css.\nUsing correct file extension\nIt's important to actually use\ncjs as the file extension here.\nYou can build your\nDesign Token set into different outputs using Style Dictionary and kickstartDS. So far we've mainly configured how token are ingested, but we'll build on our single test platform CSS in the process of this guide. Adding integrations for Storybook, the use in kickstartDS components, and so on! By re-using our pre-made configurations we only have to define a\nbuildPath to activate a platform. Optionally you can define file names with\nfiles, too.\nWith all of that in place, for the first time compile your\nDesign Token set into CSS Custom Properties now:\n1yarn build-tokens\nIf everything worked as expected, you should end up with a long\nsrc/token/tokens.css file and the following output on your terminal:\n_52yarn run v1.22.19_52$ kickstartDS tokens compile_52 _  _  _ 52| | (_) | | _| |_  _  __| || _ \\/ |52| |/ / |/ | |/ / | __/ ` | '| | | | _ _52| <| | (| <_ \\ || (| | | | || || |) |52||__|_||____/__,|| _|/|_/52_52__/\\\\\\\\__/\\___/\\\\\\\\\\__52_/\\\\////////__\\/\\_____________\\/////\\\\///_________52_________/\\\\/___________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________52________/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________52_______\\/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________52_______\\//\\____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________52________\\///\\__________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________52__/\\____\\////\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\_/\\__52\\///__\\/////////\\///////////////\\///////////__\\///___52_52Version: 1.0.4_52For more information visit:_52https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/intro/cli/_52_52Starting..._52[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_52[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_52[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_52[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_52[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_52[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_52[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_52[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_52[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_52_52css_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_52_52html_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/icons/icon-sprite.html_52_52jsx_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/icons/IconSprite.js_52_52storybook_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_52_52js_52‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.js_52[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_52[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_52[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_52Done in 2.41s.\nTo commit, or not to commit...\nIt's up to personal / team preference if the generated\nsrc/token/token.css file should be added to your repository... or your\n.gitignore.\nThere are valid arguments to make for both sides, so you should just follow what feels right for you!\nWe'll add it to our\n.gitignore:\nFine tune the design\nOnce the\nDesign Token are generated, the Design System will already have the broad look & feel of your Corporate Design!\nHowever you probably still have to tweak it a little to make it match up perfecly with your CD requirements.\nThis can be done by configuring the various\n.json files found within the\ndictionary folder.\nAdjustments in\nbackground-color.json\nCommon adjutments are made in the\nbackground-color.json file.\nNote that the same can be applied to\ntext-color.json and\nborder-color.json.\nSet\nhover /\nactive\nWe are going to be adjusting various states of\nprimary, as they are entireley dependant on the selected color.\nWhat might initially work on certain colors might not work at all on others.\nAdjustments in\ntypo.json\nThe\ntypo.json often needs touching up as there are a lot of variying factors, such as the line-heights and font-sizes.\nSet\nbp-factor\nWe want to go real big with our desktop font-size, however to have a more nuanced scaling of the font-size we need additional breakpoint-factors.\nline-height\nIf you have a hugely variying font size it makes sense to adjust the line-height.\nAdjustments in\nbackground-color.json\nCommon adjutments are made in the\nbackground-color.json file.\nNote that the same can be applied to\ntext-color.json and\nborder-color.json.\nSet\nhover /\nactive\nWe are going to be adjusting various states of\nprimary, as they are entireley dependant on the selected color.\nWhat might initially work on certain colors might not work at all on others.\nAdjustments in\ntypo.json\nThe\ntypo.json often needs touching up as there are a lot of variying factors, such as the line-heights and font-sizes.\nSet\nbp-factor\nWe want to go real big with our desktop font-size, however to have a more nuanced scaling of the font-size we need additional breakpoint-factors.\nline-height\nIf you have a hugely variying font size it makes sense to adjust the line-height.\nResult\nWith this we have completed our Design Token setup, and our branding should be successfully applied to\nkickstartDS!\nNext Step\nIn the next step we'll set up\nStorybook.

Design Application\n## Overview\nApplying your branding and corporate design to\n**kickstartDS** is itself done in roughly two steps:\n- Use a reduced set of\nBranding Tokento generate your initial Design Tokenset\n- Fine tune the resulting\nDesign Tokenset to closely fit your corporate identity\n## Apply branding\n### Initialization\nWe start by creating a file\nbranding-token.json, inside a new directory\nsrc/token... for everything to do with\n**Design Token** going forward:\n_2mkdir -p src/token_2touch src/token/branding-token.json\nThis file will hold all of our\n**Branding Token**. Those are used to initialize you first **Design Token** set, and especially ease first-time setup.\nGet the most up-to-date version of its content from here, and paste it into the file you just created:\n##### Use a current version\nBe sure to actually copy the file linked above, entering the values yourself. This way you'll be sure not to miss any recently updated token in your set up, in case this guide gets outdated!\n### Select\n**Branding Token**\nFor a more in-depth overview of those token, have a look at our foundations page about\n**Branding Token**, detailing all values in use.\nBut to get a first feel for working with the file, and to add some flavour to our Design System, we'll change some select values around. And feel free to replace everything with values that seem more appropriate for you, or that fit your particular brand (maybe even because you opted to follow the more detailed guide above). If you're wondering which values we selected for this guide... we're mostly matching our own brand for this guide:\n|Preview||Name||Value|\n### Apply\n**Branding Token**\nSo let's get right into it, customizing step by step:\n#### Start with copied\nbranding-token.json\nThis is the file you've copied before, we'll start updating it piecemeal to show off common ways of design application.\n#### Customize\nprimary color\nMost brands have such a\nprimary color as part of their corporate design guidelines. This will be used to highlight elements, and give them more importance.\nNext to\nprimary itself, we'll also define its counter part\nprimary-inverted as\n#ecff00 (\n#fff /\nwhite works for most uses otherwise, read about the finer details here).\n#### Customize\nforeground and\nlink colors\nFor this guide we'll have just change the\nforeground color, but this will influence how elements and text are rendered in components. So it is quite an influential choice.\nAdditionally we'll define some slightly different colors for our\nlink and\nlink-inverted (they always come in pairs!), to make it unique.\n#### Customize tonal colors\nThere are a bunch of tokens that, for lack of a better explanation, relate to the tone of voice the element using it should have. Most commonly this would be something like a notice shown to the user (which might be successful = positive, neutral = informative, etc).\nBecause it seems to fit our branding, and doesn't interfere with user expectations otherwise, we'll change\ninformative (and you guessed it,\ninformative-inverted) to our\nprimary color.\n#### Add a fitting font\nIn this guide we'll opt for a native system font stack for our\ndisplay and\ncopy fonts. We'll leave\ninterface and\nmono and all size values untouched for now. If you have other requirements (for example a self-hosted font, or one by Google Fonts), we'll add a guide for that soon!\n#### Adjust spacing behaviour\nAs we have a pretty dense layout in mind, we reduce\nspacing >\nscale-ratio and\nbp-ratio a bit. This will result in spacing in general scaling a bit less.\nWe keep the general spacing of\n8px, though. We'll also leave the rest of the values untouched as they'll work just fine for this guide!\n#### Start with copied\nbranding-token.json\nThis is the file you've copied before, we'll start updating it piecemeal to show off common ways of design application.\n#### Customize\nprimary color\nMost brands have such a\nprimary color as part of their corporate design guidelines.

We'll also leave the rest of the values untouched as they'll work just fine for this guide!\nNow that we have a slightly modified, up-to-date version of our\n**Branding Token** in place, we can start hooking everything up.\n**kickstartDS** Integration\nFirst, add the\nkickstartDS CLI to your project:\n_1yarn add kickstartds\nRead more about our CLI here\nThen add the following two additional lines to your\npackage.json scripts block:\ninit-tokens is used to convert your\n**Branding Token** (\nbranding-token.json) into a\n**Style Dictionary** compatible **Design Token** set (a bunch of\nJSON files), whereas\nbuild-tokens takes your\n**Design Token** set, and converts it to the outputs needed to use and display your Design System. But more about this later!\n### Generate first\n**Design Token** set\nGenerate your first full set of\n**Design Token** now, by calling:\n_1yarn init-tokens\nYour output should look roughly like this:\n_35yarn run v1.22.18_35$ kickstartDS tokens init_35_ _ _ _ _ ____ _____35| | _(_) ___| | _____| |_ __ _ _ __| |_| _ \\/ ___|_35| |/ / |/ __| |/ / __| __/ _` | '__| __| | | \\___ \\_35| <| | (__| <\\__ \\ || (_| | | | |_| |_| |___) |_35|_|\\_\\_|\\___|_|\\_\\___/\\__\\__,_|_| \\__|____/|____/_35_35______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\________35___________/\\\\\\////////__\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/////\\\\\\///_________35_________/\\\\\\/___________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________35________/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________35_______\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________35_______\\//\\\\\\____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________35________\\///\\\\\\__________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________35__/\\\\\\____\\////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\__35_\\///________\\/////////__\\///////////////__\\///////////__\\///___35_35Version: 1.0.0_35For more information visit:_35https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_35_35Starting..._35[kickstartDS: general] info: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_35[kickstartDS: tokens/init] starting: init command with init variable init-task_35[1/1] [init: check] info: checking prerequesites before starting_35[1/1] [init: check] info: prerequesites met, starting_35[init: cleanup] info: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-init-init-task before starting command_35[init: cleanup] info: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-init-init-task before starting command_35[1/1] [init: init] info: running the init subtask_35[info] generating your token set from primitives tokens file /tmp/tokens-init-init-task/token-primitives.json_35[info] successfully generated primitives tokens and wrote them to folder /tmp/tokens-init-init-task/./src/token/dictionary_35[1/1] [init: init] info: finished running the init subtask successfully_35[kickstartDS: tokens/init] finished: init command with init variable init-task_35Done in 1.19s.\nIt uses your\nbranding-token.json as an input, and generates a folder\nsrc/token/dictionary for you.

It's meant to specifically ease this workflow. Running it again will overwrite changes you manually did to your\n**Design Token** set, which is probably not intended!\nTo learn more about the categories represented by those generated files, have a look at our foundations page about them.\n### Compile\n**Design Token** set\nFinally, to test the integration works as expected, we'll first want to create one additional file:\nsd.config.cjs at our projects root. As the name may imply, this is further configuration for our\n**Design Token**, to convert them into different outputs (more specifically the **Style Dictionary** that gets used under the hood):\nAnd, as this is based on\n**Style Dictionary**, it generally follows their configuration scheme.\nLet's detail some lines:\n#### Import dependencies\nImport\nstyle-dictionary to use their native\nStyleDictionary.extend, and get our pre-made,\n**kickstartDS** compatible, configuration from\n@kickstartds/style-dictionary.\n#### Extend configuration\nOur pre-made configuration gets extended by our local project setup. That way we can reuse stuff for easier configuration, if needed.\n**Design Token** location\nWe configure the default\n**Design Token** location, which is\ntokens as a glob\nsrc/token/dictionary/**/*.json...\n#### Default SVG icons\n... and tell\n**Style Dictionary** where to look for our default icons. These are used by **kickstartDS** components, and need to be present in different formats later on (depending on the use case).\n#### Platforms\nTo test that our integration works as expected, we'll add the\n**CSS** platform for now, which will result in our **Design Token** being converted to CSS custom properties, as\nsrc/token/tokens.css.\n##### Using correct file extension\nIt's important to actually use\ncjs as the file extension here.\nYou can build your\n**Design Token** set into different outputs using **Style Dictionary** and **kickstartDS**. So far we've mainly configured how token are ingested, but we'll build on our single test platform **CSS** in the process of this guide. Adding integrations for Storybook, the use in **kickstartDS** components, and so on! By re-using our pre-made configurations we only have to define a\nbuildPath to activate a platform. Optionally you can define file names with\nfiles, too.\nWith all of that in place, for the first time compile your\n**Design Token** set into CSS Custom Properties now:\n_1yarn build-tokens\nIf

And it's the preferrable way to do it, too. You\nshould start out with just a concept of what you actually need. Which components can help in bringing that concept to life should be something you concern yourself with second.\nThis also explains why this has an additional step in \"Component Mapping\", when compared with adapting a component. This is where we will try to match our component API to existing components.\nThis works especially well in 2 cases:\n- When what you need is actually just a specialized case of one of our existing components. Like when wanting to create an article teaser, you'll probably find a general purpose\nkickstartDScomponent like the\nTeaserCardthat matches this signature really well\n- You have a rather complex component (think something like a more advanced blog head component). Often you'll find those components to be composed of basic building bricks (like\nButtons,\nTagLabels or\nHeadlines) after all, which is where component mapping to\nkickstartDScomes into the picture again\nWhen zooming in enough, everything starts to look the same\nIf you think about it, there's only a limited number of ways information can actually be presented. And oftentimes you'll find there's already preferred versions of doing it out there, what we'd call learned user interface (UI), or just best practices. The\nHamburger menu icon would be such an example. Or how certain information is often teased in the form of structured cards.\nAdhering to that expectation, and not creating unneeded artificial friction, is one big part of delivering a good user experience (UX). We're convinced we can cover a great range of those basic building blocks for you. Allowing you to concentrate on destructuring your requirements, mapping the resulting pieces to\nkickstartDS components. It's how bigger kickstartDS components like a\nStorytelling component (using\nButton,\nHeadline,\nRichText, etc) are constructed, too.\nAdditionally this can of course also be combined with customization for your own added properties, not part of the used\nkickstartDS base components (see our\nHeadline component example for that). Or be implemented using extension if the component should expand on some\nkickstartDS base component (see our\nSection component example for that).\nTo learn more about the different processes available to you when creating a component with\nkickstartDS, have a look at the overview page of this section.\nCreation process\nYou should already have an idea of what you'll need from your component, or some rough image of what it should do. We start by refining those requirements into a component API, which we'll then map to existing\nkickstartDS base components. This will then serve as our starting point for creating the actual component.\nThere are three main steps in creating a component:\n- Component definition,\n- Component mapping, and\n- Component creation\nSo the main way this differs from adapting a component is in adding \"Component Mapping\", in between \"Component definition\" and \"Component creation\". This is where we'll try to match our component API to existing components.\nWe'll also slightly deviate from it when defining our structure, as we can't just reduce an existing set of component properties here.\nAdaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\nkickstartDS components, when used as base components. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nLet's start with the definition!\n1. Component Definition\nLike the adaptation process we start by defining a component API. But unlike it, we directly write down what we need. We don't start with a blueprint this time.\nWe'll use the\nTeaserCard component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Create\nTeaserCard component\". We also have an additional example in \"Create\nInterstitial component\", but to actually implement that you need access to our\nkickstartDS content module. But following the thought process behind it can provide values nontheless.\nkickstartDS Content Module\nThe perfect addition to our Open Source base\nThe\nContent Module includes seven rich components: Hero visual, Quote, Storytelling etc. ‚Äî everything you need to build beautiful content experiences or to enrich your existing Design System\nPurpose\nWhen thinking about a component that should be part of your Design System, you should already have a strong sense of what that component should be, and what it should accomplish for you. If that's not the case, it probably isn't stable enough yet to be part of a Design System that should find wider adoption. You should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nWith that in mind, let's assume that the purpose of our component (the\nTeaserCard) is to tease content. It should look like a card while doing that, and have the obvious features one would assume a card based component to have. Like a cover image, a link, a headline and some text... with some of those potentially being optional. And because our Design System has an invert feature, it should also be invertible.\nStructure\nBefore we start implementing, we'll want to define a first rough draft of our component API. Defining a name, a small description and a rough type, per property, goes a long way in keeping the focus on the core of your component.\nLet's keep using the\nTeaserCard as an example, with the following properties being the result of pinning down our rough idea:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Headline for the teaser card|\n|Body text for the teaser card|\n|(Optional) image to display as cover|\n|Show inverted version of card?|\n|Target that should be linked|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\n2. Component Mapping\nThis is the part unique to this way of implementing a component (compared, for example, to adapting a component). We'll match the component to one, or more,\nkickstartDS base components... and potentially make some slight adjustments.\nMatching it\nMatching one or more components means finding components that are part of\nkickstartDS that can cover your use case, or one part of it. This way you create your component by composition.\nFor our\nTeaserCard, when looking through all of the existing\nkickstartDS base components (one great way of doing this is through our Storybook), we identify the\nTeaserBox as a great candidate. It:\n- has a\ntopicthat can serve as our\nheadline\n- takes\ntextfor the body copy\n- already includes options for a cover (\nimage), and even some options for it (\nratio,\nimageSpacing)\n- can be\ninverted\n- and takes a\nLinkcomponent for\nlink\nThis seems to match really well!\nAdjustments\nWhile just matching a component can already get you pretty far, oftentimes you'll want to make some more adjustments to really make everything fit for you. And while the properties may match up really well, there's still some translation to do to make it work.\nComparing\nTeaserCard and\nTeaserBox... we don't have to do anything for\ntext,\ninverted or\nimage, as these already share a name and definition. In the case of\nheadline we just have to rename the prop (from\ntopic). And for\ntarget we simplify the existing\nlink object to a single string property... hard coding the rest of the values in the process, while also renaming it.\n3. Component Creation\nIn the third and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\nJSON Schema, and create a React template matching our selected properties to the kickstartDS base component.\nJSON Schema definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\nJSON Schema for them, defining their component API in code.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nTeaserCard again:\nTeaserBox base component\nThis is the \"full\"\nTeaserBox component API /\nJSON Schema. We've just reduced the property definitions.\nSelect from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\nCreate your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\nJSON Schema...\nRenaming props\n... and we rename props as needed, in the process.\nAdd\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\nFinished component\nJSON Schema\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\nUsing multiple components\nThis process can also involve using properties from multiple components. For example when building one like the\nStorytelling component, using\nHeadline,\nButton and\nRichText.\nYou can either just merge properties on your root component, or group included components on their own property. Like adding a\nlink to something, which maps to the\nButton component and some of its properties (as their own\nobject in your\nJSON Schema).\nFor the full version of creating the\nTeaserCard have a look at our guide \"Create\nTeaserCard component\".\nReact template\nNow that our\nJSON Schema is defined, we'll automatically get matching TypeScript types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the kickstartDS base component(s), to quickly hook up our set of properties to the mapped component(s). Using auto-complete, and TypeScript telling us about required properties in the mapped component(s), this is done in light speed!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nTeaserCard, creating the component template:\nNecessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\nkickstartDS base component(s) and our own components TypeScript types.\nAdd correct type to component\nWe need to type our\nReact component to use our JSON Schema, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly. For the\nTeaserCard this means also including\nHTMLAttributes as it maps to a\n under the hood.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nFor our component\n**JSX** we can directly use the\nTeaserBoxContextDefault, which is the\n**kickstartDS** base component.\n##### Destructure additional props\nComing to our component JSX, we start by passing down (destructuring) the\nprops we're carrying through first. This ensures properties defined in our component API will always take precedence, because they're added after the general\nprops.\n##### Glue component API to base component 1/3\nThe simplest cases of connecting props to the base component is when the name of the property is taken from the base component. We can just directly pass those without much thought.\n##### Glue component API to base component 2/3\nIn some cases we might have changed the name of a prop. In that instance, we just to have to wire up the renamed property to the originally named base components property.\n##### Glue component API to base component 3/3\nFinally there might be fields where we're using a set of properties of the mapped component(s), but only expose one of those in our own component API... the rest get hard coded.\nThat's the case with our\ntarget property, which maps to the\nlink.href property of the\nTeaserBox. We hard code the required\nlabel property to\n*Read more*.\n##### Adding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\n**React** component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted a component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes the base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nButton component by default. For example we might have our own\nTeaserCard component, based on the\n**kickstartDS**\nTeaserBox which includes a\nButton.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our\nButton actually gets used, you can just change the default\nButton rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\n**React Context** in our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\n##### Visual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\n**React** components that include **TypeScript** types... like **kickstartDS** components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\n## Technical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds minimal technical debt to your Design System. Not much has been changed around, we just add a small layer on top of the original\n**kickstartDS** base component(s).\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- removal of the base component(s)\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the components template (both\nReact, and the resulting HTML)\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\n**React** template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version. Finally a removed field you're actually using would mean adding additional customization to regain that functionality. Have a look at our\nHeadline example guide to see how you'd add your own, new property!\nLearn more about what we mean by technical debt here on the overview page of this section.\n## Examples\nWe continuously expand our component example guides, below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.\n### Create\nTeaserCard component\nIn this example component guide we create the\nTeaserCard component, mapped to the\nTeaserBox component (part of the\n@kickstartDS/base module), to tease content in our Design System. We greatly simplify the\nButton to a single\nstring props, and drastically reduce the rest of the options used, and offered, in our own adaptation of the\nTeaserBox.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n### Create\nInterstitial component\nIn this example component guide we create the\nInterstitial component, mapped to the\nStorytelling component (part of the\n@kickstartDS/content module), to add interstitial content elements that break the flow of content for really emphasized call-to-actions. As with all examples, we reduce the set of options greatly.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n_1", "markdown": "# Create a component\n## Overview\nCreating a component differs from \"just\" adapting a component in that it starts out without a specific\n**kickstartDS** component already in mind.\nAll but the most obvious components will be implemented following this strategy.

This will then serve as our starting point for creating the actual component.\nThere are three main steps in creating a component:\n- Component definition,\n- Component mapping, and\n- Component creation\nSo the main way this differs from adapting a component is in adding \"Component Mapping\", in between \"Component definition\" and \"Component creation\". This is where we'll try to match our component API to existing components.\nWe'll also slightly deviate from it when defining our structure, as we can't just reduce an existing set of component properties here.\n##### Adaptation process as a base line\nIf you've read our \"Adapt a component\" guide you probably already know this:\nThis guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by\n**kickstartDS** components, when used as base components. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!\nLet's start with the definition!\n### 1. Component Definition\nLike the adaptation process we start by defining a component API. But unlike it, we directly write down what we need. We don't start with a blueprint this time.\nWe'll use the\nTeaserCard component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide \"Create\nTeaserCard component\". We also have an additional example in \"Create\nInterstitial component\", but to actually implement that you need access to our\n**kickstartDS** content module. But following the thought process behind it can provide values nontheless.\n## kickstartDS Content Module\nThe perfect addition to our Open Source base\nThe\n**Content Module** includes seven rich components: Hero visual, Quote, Storytelling etc. ‚Äî everything you need to build beautiful content experiences or to enrich your existing Design System\n#### Purpose\nWhen thinking about a component that should be part of your Design System, you should already have a strong sense of what that component should be, and what it should accomplish for you. If that's not the case, it probably isn't stable enough yet to be part of a Design System that should find wider adoption. You should probably take a step back first, and maybe start a Design System Initiative to narrow down on what components you'll really need.\nWith that in mind, let's assume that the purpose of our component (the\nTeaserCard) is to tease content. It should look like a card while doing that, and have the obvious features one would assume a card based component to have. Like a cover image, a link, a headline and some text... with some of those potentially being optional. And because our Design System has an invert feature, it should also be invertible.\n#### Structure\nBefore we start implementing, we'll want to define a first rough draft of our component API. Defining a name, a small description and a rough type, per property, goes a long way in keeping the focus on the core of your component.\nLet's keep using the\nTeaserCard as an example, with the following properties being the result of pinning down our rough idea:\n|Property||Type||Description|\n|Headline for the teaser card|\n|Body text for the teaser card|\n|(Optional) image to display as cover|\n|Show inverted version of card?|\n|Target that should be linked|\nFields that should be required are marked with a\n*.\n### 2. Component Mapping\nThis is the part unique to this way of implementing a component (compared, for example, to adapting a component). We'll match the component to one, or more,\n**kickstartDS** base components... and potentially make some slight adjustments.\n#### Matching it\nMatching one or more components means finding components that are part of\n**kickstartDS** that can cover your use case, or one part of it. This way you create your component by composition.\nFor our\nTeaserCard, when looking through all of the existing\n**kickstartDS** base components (one great way of doing this is through our **Storybook**), we identify the\nTeaserBox as a great candidate. It:\n- has a\ntopicthat can serve as our\nheadline\n- takes\ntextfor the body copy\n- already includes options for a cover (\nimage), and even some options for it (\nratio,\nimageSpacing)\n- can be\ninverted\n- and takes a\nLinkcomponent for\nlink\nThis seems to match really well!\n#### Adjustments\nWhile just matching a component can already get you pretty far, oftentimes you'll want to make some more adjustments to really make everything fit for you. And while the properties may match up really well, there's still some translation to do to make it work.\nComparing\nTeaserCard and\nTeaserBox... we don't have to do anything for\ntext,\ninverted or\nimage, as these already share a name and definition. In the case of\nheadline we just have to rename the prop (from\ntopic). And for\ntarget we simplify the existing\nlink object to a single string property... hard coding the rest of the values in the process, while also renaming it.\n### 3. Component Creation\nIn the third and final step we'll get to actually create our component. We'll encode the component API by creating its\n**JSON Schema**, and create a **React** template matching our selected properties to the **kickstartDS** base component.\n**JSON Schema** definition\nWe establish the structure of components by creating a\n**JSON Schema** for them, defining their component API in code.\nFor an abridged version of that process, have a look at the\nTeaserCard again:\nTeaserBox base component\nThis is the \"full\"\nTeaserBox component API /\n**JSON Schema**. We've just reduced the property definitions.\n#### Select from available props\nLet's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.\n#### Create your component API\nSubsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API /\n**JSON Schema**...\n#### Renaming props\n... and we rename props as needed, in the process.\n#### Add\nrequired fields\nAnd finally, set all the fields identified as\nrequired.\n#### Finished component\n**JSON Schema**\nThe finished component definition in all its glory.\n##### Using multiple components\nThis process can also involve using properties from multiple components. For example when building one like the\nStorytelling component, using\nHeadline,\nButton and\nRichText.\nYou can either just merge properties on your root component, or group included components on their own property. Like adding a\nlink to something, which maps to the\nButton component and some of its properties (as their own\nobject in your\n**JSON Schema**).\nFor the full version of creating the\nTeaserCard have a look at our guide \"Create\nTeaserCard component\".\n**React** template\nNow that our\n**JSON Schema** is defined, we'll automatically get matching **TypeScript** types for our component. We use those, combined with the types already included with the **kickstartDS** base component(s), to quickly hook up our set of properties to the mapped component(s). Using auto-complete, and **TypeScript** telling us about required properties in the mapped component(s), this is done in light speed!\nTo learn more about the tooling that create those types for you, and how to hook it up, see part four of our \"Create your Design System\" guide.\nLet's continue showcasing this process using our\nTeaserCard, creating the component template:\n##### Necessary imports\nThe main imports here are the\n**kickstartDS** base component(s) and our own components **TypeScript** types.\n##### Add correct type to component\nWe need to type our\n**React** component to use our **JSON Schema**, while also making sure native HTML attributes are passed correctly. For the\nTeaserCard this means also including\nHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> as it maps to a\n<div> under the hood.\nDoing this allows users of your component to enjoy having the same auto-complete and safety when working with your Design System.\n##### Add parameters to component\nNext we add all our components defined properties to its function signature. For properties having a default defined in your component API we add that default here, too.\nAs we also want to pass through all the props not explicitly managed by us we sponge up\n...props.\n##### Add the actual\n**JSX**\nFor our component\n**JSX** we can directly use the\nTeaserBoxContextDefault, which is the\n**kickstartDS** base component.\n##### Destructure additional props\nComing to our component JSX, we start by passing down (destructuring) the\nprops we're carrying through first. This ensures properties defined in our component API will always take precedence, because they're added after the general\nprops.\n##### Glue component API to base component 1/3\nThe simplest cases of connecting props to the base component is when the name of the property is taken from the base component. We can just directly pass those without much thought.\n##### Glue component API to base component 2/3\nIn some cases we might have changed the name of a prop. In that instance, we just to have to wire up the renamed property to the originally named base components property.\n##### Glue component API to base component 3/3\nFinally there might be fields where we're using a set of properties of the mapped component(s), but only expose one of those in our own component API... the rest get hard coded.\nThat's the case with our\ntarget property, which maps to the\nlink.href property of the\nTeaserBox. We hard code the required\nlabel property to\n*Read more*.\n##### Adding a\nProvider\nThe final part of creating our\n**React** component is adding a component\nProvider for it. As we've adapted a component here, we'll want to make sure that every time another component includes the base component, our own version of it gets used instead.\nIf you're wondering what that\nProvider we've added last is all about, think about it like this:\nThere may be other components you've built, that themselves use the base\nButton component by default. For example we might have our own\nTeaserCard component, based on the\n**kickstartDS**\nTeaserBox which includes a\nButton.\nAs a means to not having to go through every combination of those component now, making sure our\nButton actually gets used, you can just change the default\nButton rendered by adding a single\nProvider once, instead.\nLearn more about\nProviders and\n**React Context** in our dedicated page about them.\nOr look at our \"Create your Design System\" guide, where we add the general setup for\nProviders. That one also includes some more details on this!\n##### Visual Studio Code component property quick-fix\nVisual Studio Code has a great feature aiding in this workflow, with\n**React** components that include **TypeScript** types... like **kickstartDS** components do. When adding a \"bare\" component without props to your template, Visual Studio Code will offer you the option to\nAdd missing attributes.\nThis will automatically create all required options for your component. Now you just have to connect your own props to those, while hard-coding the ones you don't plan on exposing as part of your components component API.\nJust hover the squiggly, red line that should be decorating your component, and choose\nQuick Fix..., to get to that option (alternatively put your cursor on the component tag and hit\nCtrl+.).\n## Technical debt added\nThis way of creating components adds minimal technical debt to your Design System. Not much has been changed around, we just add a small layer on top of the original\n**kickstartDS** base component(s).\nRelevant underlying changes you'll have to look out for:\n- changes to the base components component API\n- removal of the base component(s)\nYou're immune to underlying changes to:\n- the components template (both\nReact, and the resulting HTML)\n- the design and layout (changes to\nCSS, SCSSand Design & Component Token)\nIn the case of a changed component API, you should have a look at the corresponding\nCHANGELOG.md and potential notes in our matching migration guide. You'll probably just need to add a newly added field to your\n**React** template, and potentially your own component API if you want to use it. If a field was changed, that might also necessitate some adaption of your own version. Finally a removed field you're actually using would mean adding additional customization to regain that functionality. Have a look at our\nHeadline example guide to see how you'd add your own, new property!\nLearn more about what we mean by technical debt here on the overview page of this section.\n## Examples\nWe continuously expand our component example guides, below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.\n### Create\nTeaserCard component\nIn this example component guide we create the\nTeaserCard component, mapped to the\nTeaserBox component (part of the\n@kickstartDS/base module), to tease content in our Design System. We greatly simplify the\nButton to a single\nstring props, and drastically reduce the rest of the options used, and offered, in our own adaptation of the\nTeaserBox.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n### Create\nInterstitial component\nIn this example component guide we create the\nInterstitial component, mapped to the\nStorytelling component (part of the\n@kickstartDS/content module), to add interstitial content elements that break the flow of content for really emphasized call-to-actions. As with all examples, we reduce the set of options greatly.\nThis is what the result looks like:\n_1"}, "lines": ["# Create a component", "## Overview", "Creating a component differs from \"just\" adapting a component in that it starts out without a specific", "**kickstartDS** component already in mind.", "All but the most obvious components will be implemented following this strategy.

For an overview, have a look at our integrations overview for Storybook.\nInstall\nStorybook\nWe start by initializing\nStorybook using their CLI. We call it with\nnpx, which runs the command (\nStorybook) without actually installing the dependency to our project. And as we won't be using their included examples, we just remove those immediately, too:\n_2npx storybook init_2rm -rf src/stories\nLet's have a look at our\npackage.json, after having added\nStorybook: Storybook dependencies\nThose are the dependencies added through using\nnpx storybook init. They ensure\nStorybook itself can be built for development and production.\nIt also includes\nStorybooks Essential addon, adding recommended addons by default: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/introduction\nNew\nscripts entries\nNext to the dependencies, two\nscripts entries were added by the\nStorybook init: Storybook: to start your Storybookin development / watch mode\nbuild-storybook: to build a production ready, deployable version of your\nStorybook\nAdd the following lines to your\n.gitignore to exclude locally built versions of\nStorybook (e.g. by calling\nyarn build-storybook):\nConfigure\nStorybook\nNow that we have installed\nStorybook, it's time to add some general configuration. We'll also add a first Welcome page to test everything configured so far actually works.\nGeneral configuration\nFor this we'll be looking at the\n.storybook folder, automatically created for us by\nnpx storybook init. It contains all general configuration to make a\nStorybook your own, and allows to really adapt it to your use case. We'll set up some integrations that are convenient to use, especially when working with kickstartDS.\nThe folder contains two files for now:\n.storybook/main.js\n.storybook/preview.js\nmain.js configuration\nThis file contains configuration for\nStorybook itself... which addons to load, additional addon configuration, Webpack build & compile configuration, and so on. We'll continue building this up while adding addons in the next steps.\nFor a detailed overview, have a look at\nStorybooks documentation.\nAfter\nnpx storybook init\nRight after running\nStorybooks initialization, you should find it looking like this.\nRemove quotes\nWe remove some quotes from\nmain.js, because we're in a\n.js file.\nDeactivate implicit Post CSS loader\nAs we don't need it, we deactivate the implicit Post CSS loader as recommended.\nYou can read more about this here.\nAdd glob for documentation\nWe'll be adding a few pages of documentation to test configuration, but these can also serve as the perfect starting point and orientation for your own growing documentation. For\nStorybook to pick up those pages, we have to tell it where those will be found. We'll be creating that folder\ndocs/ later.\nAfter\nnpx storybook init\nRight after running\nStorybooks initialization, you should find it looking like this.\nRemove quotes\nWe remove some quotes from\nmain.js, because we're in a\n.js file.\nDeactivate implicit Post CSS loader\nAs we don't need it, we deactivate the implicit Post CSS loader as recommended.\nYou can read more about this here.\nAdd glob for documentation\nWe'll be adding a few pages of documentation to test configuration, but these can also serve as the perfect starting point and orientation for your own growing documentation.

Additionally, configuration for how stories are displayed can be adjusted globally, through the exports\nparameters and\ndecorators (amongst others, learn more here).\nAfter\nnpx storybook init\nWe'll start off again with the file as created by\nStorybooks initialization.\nAdd story sorting\nAdding a\nstorySort function to the\noptions allows us to ensure the\nWelcome page will always be displayed first. Everything else should be sorted alphabetically. Learn more about\nstorySort.\nAfter\nnpx storybook init\nWe'll start off again with the file as created by\nStorybooks initialization.\nAdd story sorting\nAdding a\nstorySort function to the\noptions allows us to ensure the\nWelcome page will always be displayed first. Everything else should be sorted alphabetically. Learn more about\nstorySort.\nAdding a\nWelcome page\nAs promised we add a\nWelcome page now, to verify configuration... and to have something in Storybook to display in the browser.\nCreate a folder\ndocs at the root of your repository, and add a file\nwelcome.stories.mdx to it.\n.mdx is an extension of the popular Markdown format, allowing the use of\nReact /\nJSX components as part of your documentation. In the context of\nkickstartDS this also means being able to use all of your components as part of your Storybook documentation, too. For example having nice hero images on pages important to you!\nLearn more about the\n.mdx format here.\n_2mkdir -p docs_2touch docs/welcome.stories.mdx\nAdd the following content to it:\nDefine story title and category\nWe define a title and category for our\nWelcome page by importing and using\nMeta from\n@storybook/addon-docs, a component provided to us by\nStorybook.\nThis would also be a first example on the benefits of using\n.mdx for documentation.\nSome initial dummy content\nThe rest of the file just contains some dummy content to start. Feel free to replace this with something more meaningful, but you'll probably want to revisit this page later, anyways!\nVerifying configuration\nIt's not much, yet, but we can start our\nStorybook now to see our Welcome page in action:\n_1yarn storybook\nThis should automatically open\nStorybook in your browser of choice. Next to displaying your first page (üôå), there's something interesting that happened!\nAs part of the left sidebar, and under your initially opened\nWelcome page, there'll be a section titled\n@kickstartds/base. This gets shown because we've added\n@kickstartds/base as a dependency before.\nkickstartDS uses Storybook composition to always include the base documentation (in the correct version used by your Design System) to your Storybook, as a handy reference!\nDesign Token integration\nNext up is adding some glue code to have our\nDesign Token set nicely integrated with Storybook. We can start by copying some stories provided by kickstartDS (those are the same that can be seen here).\nAdd\nstorybook-design-token addon\nFor\nDesign Token documentation we also use\nstorybook-design-token as an addon. Mainly for its\nDesignTokenDocBlock component, which helps in rendering the pages we've copied. So we also install that, too:\n_2cp -r node_modules/@kickstartds/core/lib/design-tokens docs/tokens_2yarn add -D storybook-design-token\nBut if you start your\nStorybook now (\nyarn storybook), you'll be greeted by empty pages. That's because we've not set up the actual\nDesign Token integration with Storybook / our Style Dictionary, yet.\nIntegrate with\nStyle Dictionary\nAs the\nstorybook-design-token addon needs our tokens in a specific format (read more here), we adjust our\nStyle Dictionary configuration in\nsd.config.cjs to include the provided\nStorybook configuration. We also tell it to put those Storybook specific files into our already existing\nsrc/token directory:\nWith that change, re-build your\nDesign Token set:\n_1yarn build-tokens\nYou'll notice it now writes two additional files for you, specifically for the\nStorybook integration:\nAnnotated\ntokens.css\nThose are all of our\nDesign Token converted to CSS custom properties (as with\nsrc/token/tokens.css), but with the correct\nstorybook-design-token presenters already added.\nicons.svg icon collection\nContains a collection of all used icons. Similarly to before, they just get annotated with the correct presenters for\nstorybook-design-token for\nStorybook.\nThe file gets picked up by the addon automatically, we don't need to add any additional configuration.\n43yarn run v1.22.18_43$ kickstartDS tokens compile_43 _  _  _ 43| | (_) | | _| |_  _  __| || _ \\/ |43| |/ / |/ | |/ / | __/ ` | '| | | | _ _43| <| | (| <_ \\ || (| | | | || || |) |43||__|_||____/__,|| _|/|_/43_43__/\\\\\\\\__/\\___/\\\\\\\\\\__43_/\\\\////////__\\/\\_____________\\/////\\\\///_________43_________/\\\\/___________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________43________/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________43_______\\/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________43_______\\//\\____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________43________\\///\\__________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________43__/\\____\\////\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\_/\\__43\\///__\\/////////\\///////////////\\///////////__\\///___43_43Version: 1.0.0_43For more information visit:_43https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_43_43Starting..._43[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_43[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_43[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_43[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_43[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_43[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_43_43css_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_43_43storybook_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_43[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_43Done in 1.08s.\nIntegrate with\nStorybook manager\nThe final piece of the puzzle to get our\nDesign Token docs working is to actually load our prepared\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.css file. As this is specific to\nStorybook (we'll use the untouched, converted CSS custom properties of\nsrc/token/tokens.css for\npreview.js), this will be done in a new file\n.storybook/manager.scss. We use\nSass here, as it will be featured later in this guide for component customization, too.\nHere it helps re-using the file in\nsrc/token, while also adding some\nCSS.\nCreate the file:\n_1touch .storybook/manager.scss\nAnd add the following content to it:\nWe pull in our generated tokens with\n@use, and add some CSS to ensure the icon colors actually get inherited.\nNow that we've added a\n.scss file, we'll need to also add\nSass compilation capabilities to our project. Install\nsass and add the following lines to your\npackage.json:\n_1yarn add -D sass\nAfter adding\nsass\nA single entry in\ndevDependencies should've been added.\nRe-order\nscripts entries\nTo keep some order in our\nscripts entries, we re-order them to be sorted alphabetically before adding some more.\nTrailing commas\nIt's easy to mix up some trailing commas here!\nCompile\n.storybook/manager.scss\nWe add a script entry called\nsass-manager, which when called will compile our\nSass to a regular\nCSS file (placed in\nstatic/manager.css) to be read by\nStorybook.\nWatch mode for\n.storybook/manager.scss\nAnd while we're at it, we'll also add a watch task that can be used in development. This rebuilds your changes to\nmanager.scss live, and triggers a reload in your browser subsequently.\nAfter adding\nsass\nA single entry in\ndevDependencies should've been added.\nRe-order\nscripts entries\nTo keep some order in our\nscripts entries, we re-order them to be sorted alphabetically before adding some more.\nTrailing commas\nIt's easy to mix up some trailing commas here!\nCompile\n.storybook/manager.scss\nWe add a script entry called\nsass-manager, which when called will compile our\nSass to a regular\nCSS file (placed in\nstatic/manager.css) to be read by\nStorybook.\nWatch mode for\n.storybook/manager.scss\nAnd while we're at it, we'll also add a watch task that can be used in development. This rebuilds your changes to\nmanager.scss live, and triggers a reload in your browser subsequently.\nThe correct place to put such\nCSS specific to Storybooks UI is\n.storybook/manager-head.html (you can read more about their\nCSS escape hatches here). We'll create that file, too:\n_1touch .storybook/manager-head.html\nAnd add the following content to it:\nFinalizing\nDesign Token integration steps\nTo get\nStorybook to pick up our\nstatic folder when run / compiled, and thus above relative reference to work, we also need to tell\nStorybook about it in\n.storybook/main.js. Further we have to add the\nstorybook-design-token addon to the\naddons array. The\ndesignTokenGlob tells it where to find our token definitions (the annotated\ntoken.css from before):\nFinally, we'll disable the\nstorybook-design-token addon in Canvas views. It's output there is redundant when having explicit pages for\nDesign Token, and tends to be a bit noisy in the context of a singular component, anyway. Learn more about that option (and other ones) in the official addon documentation.\nAs this is an option concerned with the general rendering of a Story, the change will have to be made in\n.storybook/preview.js:\nIf you re-start, or re-open, your\nStorybook now (\nyarn storybook), you'll be greeted by all your glorious\nDesign Token. Neatly categorized by category and semantic meaning!\nEmpty tables in Firefox?\nThis was a bug with the\nstorybook-design-token addon, see this issue.\nThis is fixed starting with version\n2.8.0 of the addon. If you're affected, just update your version to\n^2.8.0 or higher in your\npackage.json, to fix the addon!\nWe'll add those additional files generated based on our\nDesign Token set to our\n.gitignore now:\nAdd\nStorybook theming\nWe have a\nDesign Token set, we have a Storybook... what better idea than to combine those two! Re-using our existing token to add some (reserved) theming to our general Storybook UI also serves as a great first, albeit small, demonstration for how useful a well constructed Design Token set can be!\nCreating a\nStorybook theme involves creating two files, and adding a new output format (\n.js) to our\nStyle Dictionary:\n.storybook/manager.js: used to import and set our custom theme\n.storybook/themes.js: definition of our custom theme, using the new output format\nLearn more about theming in\nStorybook.\nAdding a\nStyle Dictionary transform\nWe start off by adding the new\nStyle Dictionary transform in\nsd.config.cjs:\nThe\ntransforms ensure a naming format that we'll use in our\n.storybook/themes.js, up next. We also instruct our new transform to put the generate\nJavaScript file into our Storybook specific token folder\nsrc/token/storybook as\ntokens.js. We opt for\nJavaScript so an easy import from inside\n.storybook/themes.js is possible. This is also the reason for selecting\njavascript/es6 as the\nformat.\nWith that new transform in place, re-build your\nDesign Token set again:\n1yarn build-tokens\nYou'll be greeted by a new file being created at\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.js:\n_46yarn run v1.22.18_46$ kickstartDS tokens compile_46 _  _  _ 46| | (_) | | _| |_  _  __| || _ \\/ |46| |/ / |/ | |/ / | __/ ` | '| | | | _ _46| <| | (| <_ \\ || (| | | | || || |) |46||__|_||____/__,|| _|/|_/46_46__/\\\\\\\\__/\\___/\\\\\\\\\\__46_/\\\\////////__\\/\\_____________\\/////\\\\///_________46_________/\\\\/___________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________46________/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________46_______\\/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________46_______\\//\\____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________46________\\///\\__________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________46__/\\____\\////\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\_/\\__46\\///__\\/////////\\///////////////\\///////////__\\///___46_46Version: 1.0.0_46For more information visit:_46https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_46_46Starting..._46[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_46[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_46[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_46[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_46[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_46[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_46_46css_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_46_46storybook_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_46_46js_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.js_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_46[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_46Done in 1.17s.\nAdding\n.storybook/themes.js\nCreate the file\n.storybook/themes.js...\n_1touch .storybook/themes.js\n... and add the following content:\nWe import the\ncreate function from\nStorybook and our token. With those we create a new theme, with\nlight as the\nbase. We won't go into detail about the specific token applications now, but feel free to adjust\nbrandTitle and\nbrandUrl to your liking!\nbrandImage will be added next...\nCreate a folder\nstatic on your project root now:\n_1mkdir -p static\nFor this to work, we add our logo to the\nstatic/ directory created before, as\nlogo.svg. If you don't have a fitting logo laying around now, feel free to just use ours (right click > save as).\nAdding\n.storybook/manager.js\nNow create the second file needed,\n.storybook/manager.js...\n_1touch .storybook/manager.js\n... and add this code to it:\nWe import\naddons from\nStorybook, and our newly created theme from\n.storybook/themes.js. We combine those to apply our theme to\nStorybook.\nAdd a fitting\nfavicon\nOur final addition for this section includes changing\n.storybook/manager-head.html again. Add the following lines to it:\nThis adds a good looking, custom\nfavicon to our\nStorybook when opened in the browser, which really helps to find your own Design System... in a sea of tabs üòÖ.\nThe configuration expects the files\nfavicon/favicon.ico and\nfavicon/favicon-192-192.png to be placed in our\nstatic/ folder, like it was the case for\nlogo.svg before.\nCreate the sub directory...\n_1mkdir -p static/favicon\n... and place your files inside. If you need something to continue, feel free to use our\nfavicon.ico (right click > save as) and\nfavicon-192-192.png (right click > save as) for now!\nFinalizing\nStorybook theming\nIf you start your\nStorybook now (\nyarn storybook), you should feel right at home! You should see your own logo, your own colors and your font being applied to\nStorybook itself (or the ones you've used while testing around). Giving it your own, unique flavour... without being distracting!\nAs we've added one new generated file, we make sure to include it in our\n.gitignore:\nIntegrate with\nkickstartDS\nWhat follows is in preparation for the next big chapter, adding components. It will have no immediately visible effect now, next to a small test component that we'll add to the\nWelcome page, but ensures a smoother experience going forward... without having to return to general setup tasks all the time.\nIntegration consists mainly of adding glue code and snippets to the\nStorybook configuration, to tell it about the existence of kickstartDS. How code should be handled, where\nCSS is located, and how our\nIcons work!\nTranspile\n@kickstartDS components\nBase components installed as part of\n@kickstartDS dependencies (e.g.\n@kickstartDS/base) are placed in your\nnode_modules after installation. For those components to be compatible with\nStorybook, and its build & compilation pipeline, we need to ensure that they get transpiled (like your local code automatically is). Add the following\nwebpackFinal configuration to\n.storybook/main.js:\nThis sets up everything needed to import components from\n@kickstartDS (e.g.\nimport { Button } from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/button\"). First we add exemptions to the\nbabel-loader for JavaScript code transpilation, which normally ignores code in\nnode_modules. Additionally we add loaders for\nCSS / SCSS, allow includes from\nnode_modules, configure the path our code lives in, and configure\nmainFields (learn about them here).\nRead more about\nStorybooks Webpack builder, or Webpack in general, for details.\nAdding a demo\nButton\nTo test our\nStorybook setup and integration actually works, we add a\nButton to our\nWelcome page.\nFirst we import the\nButton component from\n@kickstartds/base/lib/button, to then add it to the end of the page with a\nlabel of \"Learn more\". To see all available options for such a\nButton component have a look at our\nStorybook.\nIf not still running, start your\nStorybook again now (\nyarn storybook), and browse to the\nWelcome page. You should be greeted by your newly added\nButton there. But there's something missing. It's not looking quite right, yet!\nAdd missing styles in\npreview.js\nWe need some base styles and JavaScript provided by\n@kickstartds/base, and our own\nDesign Token set, the one converted to CSS custom properties in\nsrc/token/tokens.css.\nAdd the following lines to your\n.storybook/preview.js:\nRe-start\nStorybook to revisit the Welcome page. Everything should be looking as expected now!\nAdding an\nIcon to our\nButton\nAs a small motivation for the next section, change the\nButton markup in\ndocs/welcome.stories.jsx slightly:\nWe add an\nIcon to the button using\niconAfter (you can use\niconAfter or\niconBefore, or both!). To see a list of available\nIcons you can have a look at your\nStorybook. It should have a page titled\nIcons in the Design Tokens category. This has all of your\n.svg icons compiled, all those are possible inputs for\nicon here.\nTo see all options available on a\nButton, have a look at its documentation in\nStorybook (either in our docs, or locally through the composed docs in your sidebar).\nIf you re-check your\nWelcome page in the browser again now, you'll see the button having space reserved for an\nIcon. But the\nIcon itself is still missing. This is because we haven't included our\nIcon Sprite for component previews in Storybook, yet. The only reason they're successfully displayed on your Icons page currently, is that the\nstorybook-design-token addon is picking them up using its own loader.\nLet's add our\nIcon Sprite to Storybook for real, now!\nIntegrate\nIcons with\nStorybook previews\nInstead of loading a bunch of single files per icon, we encourage compiling all your\nSVGs into one sprite. We offer different output formats for that through the pre-configured\nStyle Dictionary in use (SVG, HTML, React). This can be included once in the page, and the elements will just be referenced. Learn more about sprites with\n and\n on MDN.\nAs with other changes that had to do with how\nStorybook renders our own components (in a preview context), we will need to adjust\n.storybook/preview.js again to integrate\nkickstartDS and Storybook:\nWe wrap\nStorybooks story rendering in two places. Firstly we import the default\nDocsContainer from\n@storybook/addon-docs and our\nIcons from\n../src/token/icons/IconSprite, to then ensure that every time a docs page is rendered, our\nIcons get included there, too. Secondly we add our first decorator to the\ndecorators array, also adding our imported\nIcons. This one is concerned with all the other story previews there are, read more about decorators here.\nYou might have stumbled over our\nIcons import above:\nimport IconSprite from \"../src/token/icons/IconSprite\". That file doesn't actually exist (yet)! You might also recall how we've added annotated\nDesign Token before, by adding a new transform to our Style Dictionary configuration. We'll now add another transform to it that takes our Icons and converts them to a\nJSX component-variant of our\nIconSprite, ready to be imported in\n.storybook/preview.js:\nAnd, you know the drill by now, after changing our\nsd.config.cjs we'll want to re-compile our\nStyle Dictionary...\n1yarn build-tokens\n... to find a new output for\njsx in the log, written to\nsrc/token/icons/IconSprite.js, as referenced by\n.storybook/preview.js:\n_49yarn run v1.22.18_49$ kickstartDS tokens compile_49 _  _  _ 49| | (_) | | _| |_  _  __| || _ \\/ |49| |/ / |/ | |/ / | __/ ` | '| | | | _ _49| <| | (| <_ \\ || (| | | | || || |) |49||__|_||____/__,|| _|/|_/49_49__/\\\\\\\\__/\\___/\\\\\\\\\\__49_/\\\\////////__\\/\\_____________\\/////\\\\///_________49_________/\\\\/___________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________49________/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________49_______\\/\\_____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________49_______\\//\\____________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________49________\\///\\__________\\/\\_________________\\/\\____________49__/\\____\\////\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/\\\\\\\\\\_/\\__49\\///__\\/////////\\///////////////\\///////////__\\///___49_49Version: 1.0.0_49For more information visit:_49https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_49_49Starting..._49[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_49[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_49[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_49[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_49[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_49[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_49_49css_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_49_49jsx_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/icons/IconSprite.js_49_49storybook_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_49_49js_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.js_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_49[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_49Done in 1.49s.\n(Re-)open your\nStorybook now and change to the Welcome page. You should be greeted by a\nButton with its\nIcon visible, as configured in the component props!\nLike before, we make sure to include the newly generated file in our\n.gitignore:\nIntegrate\nkickstartDS\nradio with\nStorybook actions\nWe use a small, light-weight communication component called\nradio (basically a mini PubSub) in all existing components for communication and event handling. It's part of our\nCore (\n@kickstartDS/core) architecture. To make debugging easier and more transparent, we connect our\nradio with\nStorybooks actions, and their actions addon.\nConfiguration is pretty easy, just add the following lines to\n.storybook/preview.js:\nNow everytime a\nkickstartDS component emits an event over\nradio, it will be displayed in the\nActions tab in Storybook.\nInstall remaining addons\nLike the last step, this one will also mostly be done in preparation. We add some more addons, that each add a specific view of your components to\nStorybook: HTMLrendering addon JSON Schemaaddon Component Tokenaddon\nThis will give you a great overview of all aspects that make up a component in a Design System in general, and with\nkickstartDS specifically. Especially helpful while adding components in the next main chapter of this guide!\nFirst add the addons to your project:\n_1yarn add -D @kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens @kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema @whitespace/storybook-addon-html@git+https://github.com/lmestel/storybook-addon-html.git\nFork of @whitespace/storybook-addon-html\nWe currently need a fork of\n@whitespace/storybook-addon-html, because the original version of the addon just takes the\nHTML from the browser. This is problematic, because it means that markup might already be manipulated by client-side\nJavaScript (e.g. some classes being added). For our use, copy & paste of the initial\nHTML, we've switched the addon to use\nReacts SSR Renderer.\nTo activate those addons, we need to add them to\n.storybook/main.js, too. They don't need any further configuration:\nFork of @whitespace/storybook-addon-html\nWe deactivate\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema for now, because there's a bug that needs to be fixed to make it compatible with the Open Source\n2.0.0 release of\nkickstartDS. You can follow the progress for this on the following ticket: kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema/issues/19\nReview changes\nLet us review our\npackage.json again now, it's starting to grow already:\nHTML rendering addon\nWe use\n@whitespace/storybook-addon-html to add a tab to every component Canvas sidebar, where you can copy the currently configured component as a plain HTML component.\nDesign Token addon\nFor\nDesign Token documentation we use\nstorybook-design-token. Mainly for its\nDesignTokenDocBlock component, which helps rendering the pages we'll create to display our\nDesign Token set. JSON Schema addon\nWe use our own\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema to display our component structure / API in a Canvas tab, alongside the component.\nRead more about it on our dedicated integration page.\nComponent Token addon\nFor this we use another Canvas and tab based addon we've written ourselves, to visualize your Component Token:\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-token. Especially helps discovering the token layering applied to a component.\nRead more about it on our dedicated integration page.\nResult\nWith that, we've successfully added\nStorybook to our Design System, integrated it with our Design Token / Style Dictionary, adopted some concepts of kickstartDS, and even added a bit of theming! We have our main setup running now, including Storybook.\nNext Step\nIt's time to get to the exciting part... adding components to our Design System. To learn about the different ways you can go about in that, follow our next section!\nCode Sandbox\nSee the result of this step in the\nCode Sandbox below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on Github directly in the\nds-guide repository, there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on the branch\nstep/3 in the guide:\nToggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, or open it directly in your browser.", "markdown": "# 3. Configure Storybook\n## Overview\nWe use\n**Storybook** for a lot of different useful features it offers. For an overview, have a look at our integrations overview for **Storybook**.\n## Install\n**Storybook**\nWe start by initializing\n**Storybook** using their CLI. We call it with\nnpx, which runs the command (\n**Storybook**) without actually installing the dependency to our project. And as we won't be using their included examples, we just remove those immediately, too:\n_2npx storybook init_2rm -rf src/stories\nLet's have a look at our\npackage.json, after having added\n**Storybook**: **Storybook** dependencies\nThose are the dependencies added through using\nnpx storybook init. They ensure\n**Storybook** itself can be built for development and production.\nIt also includes\n**Storybook**s Essential addon, adding recommended addons by default: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/introduction\n### New\nscripts entries\nNext to the dependencies, two\nscripts entries were added by the\n**Storybook** init: Storybook: to start your Storybookin development / watch mode\nbuild-storybook: to build a production ready, deployable version of your\nStorybook\nAdd the following lines to your\n.gitignore to exclude locally built versions of\n**Storybook** (e.g. by calling\nyarn build-storybook):\n## Configure\n**Storybook**\nNow that we have installed\n**Storybook**, it's time to add some general configuration. We'll also add a first *Welcome* page to test everything configured so far actually works.\n### General configuration\nFor this we'll be looking at the\n.storybook folder, automatically created for us by\nnpx storybook init. It contains all general configuration to make a\n**Storybook** your own, and allows to really adapt it to your use case. We'll set up some integrations that are convenient to use, especially when working with **kickstartDS**.\nThe folder contains two files for now:\n.storybook/main.js\n.storybook/preview.js\nmain.js configuration\nThis file contains configuration for\n**Storybook** itself... which addons to load, additional addon configuration, Webpack build & compile configuration, and so on. We'll continue building this up while adding addons in the next steps.\nFor a detailed overview, have a look at\n**Storybook**s documentation.\n##### After\nnpx storybook init\nRight after running\n**Storybook**s initialization, you should find it looking like this.\n##### Remove quotes\nWe remove some quotes from\nmain.js, because we're in a\n.js file.\n##### Deactivate implicit Post CSS loader\nAs we don't need it, we deactivate the implicit Post CSS loader as recommended.\nYou can read more about this here.\n##### Add glob for documentation\nWe'll be adding a few pages of documentation to test configuration, but these can also serve as the perfect starting point and orientation for your own growing documentation. For\n**Storybook** to pick up those pages, we have to tell it where those will be found. We'll be creating that folder\ndocs/ later.\n##### After\nnpx storybook init\nRight after running\n**Storybook**s initialization, you should find it looking like this.\n##### Remove quotes\nWe remove some quotes from\nmain.js, because we're in a\n.js file.\n##### Deactivate implicit Post CSS loader\nAs we don't need it, we deactivate the implicit Post CSS loader as recommended.\nYou can read more about this here.\n##### Add glob for documentation\nWe'll be adding a few pages of documentation to test configuration, but these can also serve as the perfect starting point and orientation for your own growing documentation.

Additionally, configuration for how stories are displayed can be adjusted globally, through the exports\nparameters and\ndecorators (amongst others, learn more here).\n##### After\nnpx storybook init\nWe'll start off again with the file as created by\n**Storybook**s initialization.\n##### Add story sorting\nAdding a\nstorySort function to the\noptions allows us to ensure the\n*Welcome* page will always be displayed first. Everything else should be sorted alphabetically. Learn more about\nstorySort.\n##### After\nnpx storybook init\nWe'll start off again with the file as created by\n**Storybook**s initialization.\n##### Add story sorting\nAdding a\nstorySort function to the\noptions allows us to ensure the\n*Welcome* page will always be displayed first. Everything else should be sorted alphabetically. Learn more about\nstorySort.\n#### Adding a\n*Welcome* page\nAs promised we add a\n*Welcome* page now, to verify configuration... and to have something in **Storybook** to display in the browser.\nCreate a folder\ndocs at the root of your repository, and add a file\nwelcome.stories.mdx to it.\n.mdx is an extension of the popular Markdown format, allowing the use of\nReact /\nJSX components as part of your documentation. In the context of\n**kickstartDS** this also means being able to use all of your components as part of your **Storybook** documentation, too. For example having nice hero images on pages important to you!\nLearn more about the\n.mdx format here.\n_2mkdir -p docs_2touch docs/welcome.stories.mdx\nAdd the following content to it:\n##### Define story title and category\nWe define a title and category for our\n*Welcome* page by importing and using\nMeta from\n@storybook/addon-docs, a component provided to us by\n**Storybook**.\nThis would also be a first example on the benefits of using\n.mdx for documentation.\n##### Some initial dummy content\nThe rest of the file just contains some dummy content to start. Feel free to replace this with something more meaningful, but you'll probably want to revisit this page later, anyways!\n#### Verifying configuration\nIt's not much, yet, but we can start our\n**Storybook** now to see our *Welcome* page in action:\n_1yarn storybook\nThis should automatically open\n**Storybook** in your browser of choice. Next to displaying your first page (üôå), there's something interesting that happened!\nAs part of the left sidebar, and under your initially opened\n*Welcome* page, there'll be a section titled\n@kickstartds/base. This gets shown because we've added\n@kickstartds/base as a dependency before.\n**kickstartDS** uses Storybook composition to always include the base documentation (in the correct version used by your Design System) to your **Storybook**, as a handy reference!\n**Design Token** integration\nNext up is adding some glue code to have our\n**Design Token** set nicely integrated with **Storybook**. We can start by copying some stories provided by **kickstartDS** (those are the same that can be seen here).\n#### Add\nstorybook-design-token addon\nFor\n**Design Token** documentation we also use\nstorybook-design-token as an addon. Mainly for its\nDesignTokenDocBlock component, which helps in rendering the pages we've copied. So we also install that, too:\n_2cp -r node_modules/@kickstartds/core/lib/design-tokens docs/tokens_2yarn add -D storybook-design-token\nBut if you start your\n**Storybook** now (\nyarn storybook), you'll be greeted by empty pages. That's because we've not set up the actual\n**Design Token** integration with **Storybook** / our **Style Dictionary**, yet.\n#### Integrate with\n**Style Dictionary**\nAs the\nstorybook-design-token addon needs our tokens in a specific format (read more here), we adjust our\n**Style Dictionary** configuration in\nsd.config.cjs to include the provided\n**Storybook** configuration. We also tell it to put those **Storybook** specific files into our already existing\nsrc/token directory:\nWith that change, re-build your\n**Design Token** set:\n_1yarn build-tokens\nYou'll notice it now writes two additional files for you, specifically for the\n**Storybook** integration:\n##### Annotated\ntokens.css\nThose are all of our\n**Design Token** converted to CSS custom properties (as with\nsrc/token/tokens.css), but with the correct\nstorybook-design-token presenters already added.\nicons.svg icon collection\nContains a collection of all used icons. Similarly to before, they just get annotated with the correct presenters for\nstorybook-design-token for\n**Storybook**.\nThe file gets picked up by the addon automatically, we don't need to add any additional configuration.\n_43yarn run v1.22.18_43$ kickstartDS tokens compile_43_ _ _ _ _ ____ _____43| | _(_) ___| | _____| |_ __ _ _ __| |_| _ \\/ ___|_43| |/ / |/ __| |/ / __| __/ _` | '__| __| | | \\___ \\_43| <| | (__| <\\__ \\ || (_| | | | |_| |_| |___) |_43|_|\\_\\_|\\___|_|\\_\\___/\\__\\__,_|_| \\__|____/|____/_43_43______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\________43___________/\\\\\\////////__\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/////\\\\\\///_________43_________/\\\\\\/___________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________43________/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________43_______\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________43_______\\//\\\\\\____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________43________\\///\\\\\\__________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________43__/\\\\\\____\\////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\__43_\\///________\\/////////__\\///////////////__\\///////////__\\///___43_43Version: 1.0.0_43For more information visit:_43https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_43_43Starting..._43[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_43[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_43[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_43[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_43[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_43[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_43_43css_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_43_43storybook_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_43‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_43[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_43[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_43Done in 1.08s.\n#### Integrate with\n**Storybook** manager\nThe final piece of the puzzle to get our\n**Design Token** docs working is to actually load our prepared\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.css file. As this is specific to\n**Storybook** (we'll use the untouched, converted CSS custom properties of\nsrc/token/tokens.css for\npreview.js), this will be done in a new file\n.storybook/manager.scss. We use\nSass here, as it will be featured later in this guide for component customization, too.\nHere it helps re-using the file in\nsrc/token, while also adding some\n**CSS**.\nCreate the file:\n_1touch .storybook/manager.scss\nAnd add the following content to it:\nWe pull in our generated tokens with\n@use, and add some CSS to ensure the icon colors actually get inherited.\nNow that we've added a\n.scss file, we'll need to also add\nSass compilation capabilities to our project. Install\nsass and add the following lines to your\npackage.json:\n_1yarn add -D sass\n##### After adding\nsass\nA single entry in\ndevDependencies should've been added.\n##### Re-order\nscripts entries\nTo keep some order in our\nscripts entries, we re-order them to be sorted alphabetically before adding some more.\n##### Trailing commas\nIt's easy to mix up some trailing commas here!\n##### Compile\n.storybook/manager.scss\nWe add a script entry called\nsass-manager, which when called will compile our\nSass to a regular\n**CSS** file (placed in\nstatic/manager.css) to be read by\n**Storybook**.\n##### Watch mode for\n.storybook/manager.scss\nAnd while we're at it, we'll also add a watch task that can be used in development. This rebuilds your changes to\nmanager.scss live, and triggers a reload in your browser subsequently.\n##### After adding\nsass\nA single entry in\ndevDependencies should've been added.\n##### Re-order\nscripts entries\nTo keep some order in our\nscripts entries, we re-order them to be sorted alphabetically before adding some more.\n##### Trailing commas\nIt's easy to mix up some trailing commas here!\n##### Compile\n.storybook/manager.scss\nWe add a script entry called\nsass-manager, which when called will compile our\nSass to a regular\n**CSS** file (placed in\nstatic/manager.css) to be read by\n**Storybook**.\n##### Watch mode for\n.storybook/manager.scss\nAnd while we're at it, we'll also add a watch task that can be used in development. This rebuilds your changes to\nmanager.scss live, and triggers a reload in your browser subsequently.\nThe correct place to put such\n**CSS** specific to **Storybook**s UI is\n.storybook/manager-head.html (you can read more about their\nCSS escape hatches here). We'll create that file, too:\n_1touch .storybook/manager-head.html\nAnd add the following content to it:\n#### Finalizing\n**Design Token** integration steps\nTo get\n**Storybook** to pick up our\nstatic folder when run / compiled, and thus above relative reference to work, we also need to tell\n**Storybook** about it in\n.storybook/main.js. Further we have to add the\nstorybook-design-token addon to the\naddons array. The\ndesignTokenGlob tells it where to find our token definitions (the annotated\ntoken.css from before):\nFinally, we'll disable the\nstorybook-design-token addon in Canvas views. It's output there is redundant when having explicit pages for\n**Design Token**, and tends to be a bit noisy in the context of a singular component, anyway. Learn more about that option (and other ones) in the official addon documentation.\nAs this is an option concerned with the general rendering of a Story, the change will have to be made in\n.storybook/preview.js:\nIf you re-start, or re-open, your\n**Storybook** now (\nyarn storybook), you'll be greeted by all your glorious\n**Design Token**. Neatly categorized by category and semantic meaning!\n##### Empty tables in Firefox?\nThis was a bug with the\nstorybook-design-token addon, see this issue.\nThis is fixed starting with version\n2.8.0 of the addon. If you're affected, just update your version to\n^2.8.0 or higher in your\npackage.json, to fix the addon!\nWe'll add those additional files generated based on our\n**Design Token** set to our\n.gitignore now:\n### Add\n**Storybook** theming\nWe have a\n**Design Token** set, we have a **Storybook**... what better idea than to combine those two! Re-using our existing token to add some (reserved) theming to our general **Storybook** UI also serves as a great first, albeit small, demonstration for how useful a well constructed **Design Token** set can be!\nCreating a\n**Storybook** theme involves creating two files, and adding a new output format (\n.js) to our\n**Style Dictionary**:\n.storybook/manager.js: used to import and set our custom theme\n.storybook/themes.js: definition of our custom theme, using the new output format\nLearn more about theming in\n**Storybook**.\n#### Adding a\n**Style Dictionary** transform\nWe start off by adding the new\n**Style Dictionary** transform in\nsd.config.cjs:\nThe\ntransforms ensure a naming format that we'll use in our\n.storybook/themes.js, up next. We also instruct our new transform to put the generate\n**JavaScript** file into our **Storybook** specific token folder\nsrc/token/storybook as\ntokens.js. We opt for\n**JavaScript** so an easy import from inside\n.storybook/themes.js is possible. This is also the reason for selecting\njavascript/es6 as the\nformat.\nWith that new transform in place, re-build your\n**Design Token** set again:\n_1yarn build-tokens\nYou'll be greeted by a new file being created at\nsrc/token/storybook/tokens.js:\n_46yarn run v1.22.18_46$ kickstartDS tokens compile_46_ _ _ _ _ ____ _____46| | _(_) ___| | _____| |_ __ _ _ __| |_| _ \\/ ___|_46| |/ / |/ __| |/ / __| __/ _` | '__| __| | | \\___ \\_46| <| | (__| <\\__ \\ || (_| | | | |_| |_| |___) |_46|_|\\_\\_|\\___|_|\\_\\___/\\__\\__,_|_| \\__|____/|____/_46_46______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\________46___________/\\\\\\////////__\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/////\\\\\\///_________46_________/\\\\\\/___________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________46________/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________46_______\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________46_______\\//\\\\\\____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________46________\\///\\\\\\__________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________46__/\\\\\\____\\////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\__46_\\///________\\/////////__\\///////////////__\\///////////__\\///___46_46Version: 1.0.0_46For more information visit:_46https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_46_46Starting..._46[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_46[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_46[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_46[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_46[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_46[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_46_46css_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_46_46storybook_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_46_46js_46‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.js_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_46[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_46[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_46Done in 1.17s.\n#### Adding\n.storybook/themes.js\nCreate the file\n.storybook/themes.js...\n_1touch .storybook/themes.js\n... and add the following content:\nWe import the\ncreate function from\n**Storybook** and our token. With those we create a new theme, with\nlight as the\nbase. We won't go into detail about the specific token applications now, but feel free to adjust\nbrandTitle and\nbrandUrl to your liking!\nbrandImage will be added next...\nCreate a folder\nstatic on your project root now:\n_1mkdir -p static\nFor this to work, we add our logo to the\nstatic/ directory created before, as\nlogo.svg. If you don't have a fitting logo laying around now, feel free to just use ours (right click > save as).\n#### Adding\n.storybook/manager.js\nNow create the second file needed,\n.storybook/manager.js...\n_1touch .storybook/manager.js\n... and add this code to it:\nWe import\naddons from\n**Storybook**, and our newly created theme from\n.storybook/themes.js. We combine those to apply our theme to\n**Storybook**.\n#### Add a fitting\nfavicon\nOur final addition for this section includes changing\n.storybook/manager-head.html again. Add the following lines to it:\nThis adds a good looking, custom\nfavicon to our\n**Storybook** when opened in the browser, which really helps to find your own **Design System**... in a sea of tabs üòÖ.\nThe configuration expects the files\nfavicon/favicon.ico and\nfavicon/favicon-192-192.png to be placed in our\nstatic/ folder, like it was the case for\nlogo.svg before.\nCreate the sub directory...\n_1mkdir -p static/favicon\n... and place your files inside. If you need something to continue, feel free to use our\nfavicon.ico (right click > save as) and\nfavicon-192-192.png (right click > save as) for now!\n#### Finalizing\n**Storybook** theming\nIf you start your\n**Storybook** now (\nyarn storybook), you should feel right at home! You should see your own logo, your own colors and your font being applied to\n**Storybook** itself (or the ones you've used while testing around). Giving it your own, unique flavour... without being distracting!\nAs we've added one new generated file, we make sure to include it in our\n.gitignore:\n### Integrate with\n**kickstartDS**\nWhat follows is in preparation for the next big chapter, adding components. It will have no immediately visible effect now, next to a small test component that we'll add to the\n*Welcome* page, but ensures a smoother experience going forward... without having to return to general setup tasks all the time.\nIntegration consists mainly of adding glue code and snippets to the\n**Storybook** configuration, to tell it about the existence of **kickstartDS**. How code should be handled, where\nCSS is located, and how our\n**Icons** work!\n#### Transpile\n@kickstartDS components\nBase components installed as part of\n@kickstartDS dependencies (e.g.\n@kickstartDS/base) are placed in your\nnode_modules after installation. For those components to be compatible with\n**Storybook**, and its build & compilation pipeline, we need to ensure that they get transpiled (like your local code automatically is). Add the following\nwebpackFinal configuration to\n.storybook/main.js:\nThis sets up everything needed to import components from\n@kickstartDS (e.g.\nimport { Button } from \"@kickstartds/base/lib/button\"). First we add exemptions to the\nbabel-loader for JavaScript code transpilation, which normally ignores code in\nnode_modules. Additionally we add loaders for\n**CSS** / **SCSS**, allow includes from\nnode_modules, configure the path our code lives in, and configure\nmainFields (learn about them here).\nRead more about\n**Storybook**s **Webpack** builder, or **Webpack** in general, for details.\n#### Adding a demo\nButton\nTo test our\n**Storybook** setup and integration actually works, we add a\nButton to our\n*Welcome* page.\nFirst we import the\nButton component from\n@kickstartds/base/lib/button, to then add it to the end of the page with a\nlabel of \"Learn more\". To see all available options for such a\nButton component have a look at our\n**Storybook**.\nIf not still running, start your\n**Storybook** again now (\nyarn storybook), and browse to the\n*Welcome* page. You should be greeted by your newly added\nButton there. But there's something missing. It's not looking quite right, yet!\n#### Add missing styles in\npreview.js\nWe need some base styles and JavaScript provided by\n@kickstartds/base, and our own\n**Design Token** set, the one converted to **CSS custom properties** in\nsrc/token/tokens.css.\nAdd the following lines to your\n.storybook/preview.js:\nRe-start\n**Storybook** to revisit the *Welcome* page. Everything should be looking as expected now!\n#### Adding an\nIcon to our\nButton\nAs a small motivation for the next section, change the\nButton markup in\ndocs/welcome.stories.jsx slightly:\nWe add an\nIcon to the button using\niconAfter (you can use\niconAfter or\niconBefore, or both!). To see a list of available\nIcons you can have a look at your\nStorybook. It should have a page titled\n**Icons** in the **Design Tokens** category. This has all of your\n.svg icons compiled, all those are possible inputs for\nicon here.\nTo see all options available on a\nButton, have a look at its documentation in\nStorybook (either in our docs, or locally through the composed docs in your sidebar).\nIf you re-check your\n*Welcome* page in the browser again now, you'll see the button having space reserved for an\nIcon. But the\nIcon itself is still missing. This is because we haven't included our\n**Icon Sprite** for component previews in **Storybook**, yet. The only reason they're successfully displayed on your **Icons** page currently, is that the\nstorybook-design-token addon is picking them up using its own loader.\nLet's add our\n**Icon Sprite** to **Storybook** for real, now!\n#### Integrate\nIcons with\n**Storybook** previews\nInstead of loading a bunch of single files per icon, we encourage compiling all your\nSVGs into one sprite. We offer different output formats for that through the pre-configured\n**Style Dictionary** in use (SVG, HTML, React). This can be included once in the page, and the elements will just be referenced. Learn more about sprites with\n<symbol> and\n<use> on MDN.\nAs with other changes that had to do with how\n**Storybook** renders our own components (in a preview context), we will need to adjust\n.storybook/preview.js again to integrate\n**kickstartDS** and **Storybook**:\nWe wrap\n**Storybook**s story rendering in two places. Firstly we import the default\nDocsContainer from\n@storybook/addon-docs and our\n**Icons** from\n../src/token/icons/IconSprite, to then ensure that every time a docs page is rendered, our\n**Icons** get included there, too. Secondly we add our first decorator to the\ndecorators array, also adding our imported\n**Icons**. This one is concerned with all the other story previews there are, read more about decorators here.\nYou might have stumbled over our\n**Icons** import above:\nimport IconSprite from \"../src/token/icons/IconSprite\". That file doesn't actually exist (yet)! You might also recall how we've added annotated\n**Design Token** before, by adding a new transform to our **Style Dictionary** configuration. We'll now add another transform to it that takes our **Icons** and converts them to a\nJSX component-variant of our\nIconSprite, ready to be imported in\n.storybook/preview.js:\nAnd, you know the drill by now, after changing our\nsd.config.cjs we'll want to re-compile our\n**Style Dictionary**...\n_1yarn build-tokens\n... to find a new output for\njsx in the log, written to\nsrc/token/icons/IconSprite.js, as referenced by\n.storybook/preview.js:\n_49yarn run v1.22.18_49$ kickstartDS tokens compile_49_ _ _ _ _ ____ _____49| | _(_) ___| | _____| |_ __ _ _ __| |_| _ \\/ ___|_49| |/ / |/ __| |/ / __| __/ _` | '__| __| | | \\___ \\_49| <| | (__| <\\__ \\ || (_| | | | |_| |_| |___) |_49|_|\\_\\_|\\___|_|\\_\\___/\\__\\__,_|_| \\__|____/|____/_49_49______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\______________/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\________49___________/\\\\\\////////__\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/////\\\\\\///_________49_________/\\\\\\/___________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________49________/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________49_______\\/\\\\\\_____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________49_______\\//\\\\\\____________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________49________\\///\\\\\\__________\\/\\\\\\_________________\\/\\\\\\____________49__/\\\\\\____\\////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\__/\\\\\\__49_\\///________\\/////////__\\///////////////__\\///////////__\\///___49_49Version: 1.0.0_49For more information visit:_49https://www.kickstartDS.com/docs/intro/cli_49_49Starting..._49[kickstartDS: general] [info]: welcome to the kickstartDS CLI_49[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] starting: compile command with compile variable compile-task_49[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: checking prerequesites before starting_49[1/1] [compile: check] [info]: prerequesites met, starting_49[compile: cleanup] [info]: cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_49[compile: cleanup] [info]: finished cleaning up temp dir /tmp/tokens-compile-compile-task before starting command_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: running the compile subtask_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: getting Style Dictionary from token files_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: compiling Style Dictionary to needed CSS and assets_49_49css_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/tokens.css_49_49jsx_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/icons/IconSprite.js_49_49storybook_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.css_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/icons.svg_49_49js_49‚úîÔ∏é src/token/storybook/tokens.js_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: copying generated CSS and assets to local folder_49[1/1] [compile: compile] [info]: finished running the compile subtask successfully_49[kickstartDS: tokens/compile] finished: compile command with compile variable compile-task_49Done in 1.49s.\n(Re-)open your\n**Storybook** now and change to the *Welcome* page. You should be greeted by a\nButton with its\nIcon visible, as configured in the component props!\nLike before, we make sure to include the newly generated file in our\n.gitignore:\n#### Integrate\n**kickstartDS**\nradio with\n**Storybook** actions\nWe use a small, light-weight communication component called\nradio (basically a mini PubSub) in all existing components for communication and event handling. It's part of our\n**Core** (\n@kickstartDS/core) architecture. To make debugging easier and more transparent, we connect our\nradio with\n**Storybook**s actions, and their actions addon.\nConfiguration is pretty easy, just add the following lines to\n.storybook/preview.js:\nNow everytime a\n**kickstartDS** component emits an event over\nradio, it will be displayed in the\n**Actions** tab in **Storybook**.\n### Install remaining addons\nLike the last step, this one will also mostly be done in preparation. We add some more addons, that each add a specific view of your components to\n**Storybook**: HTMLrendering addon JSON Schemaaddon Component Tokenaddon\nThis will give you a great overview of all aspects that make up a component in a Design System in general, and with\n**kickstartDS** specifically. Especially helpful while adding components in the next main chapter of this guide!\nFirst add the addons to your project:\n_1yarn add -D @kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens @kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema @whitespace/storybook-addon-html@git+https://github.com/lmestel/storybook-addon-html.git\n##### Fork of @whitespace/storybook-addon-html\nWe currently need a fork of\n@whitespace/storybook-addon-html, because the original version of the addon just takes the\nHTML from the browser. This is problematic, because it means that markup might already be manipulated by client-side\n**JavaScript** (e.g. some classes being added). For our use, copy & paste of the initial\nHTML, we've switched the addon to use\n**React**s SSR Renderer.\nTo activate those addons, we need to add them to\n.storybook/main.js, too. They don't need any further configuration:\n##### Fork of @whitespace/storybook-addon-html\nWe deactivate\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema for now, because there's a bug that needs to be fixed to make it compatible with the Open Source\n2.0.0 release of\n**kickstartDS**. You can follow the progress for this on the following ticket: kickstartDS/storybook-addon-jsonschema/issues/19\n## Review changes\nLet us review our\npackage.json again now, it's starting to grow already:\n**HTML** rendering addon\nWe use\n@whitespace/storybook-addon-html to add a tab to every component Canvas sidebar, where you can copy the currently configured component as a plain HTML component.\n**Design Token** addon\nFor\n**Design Token** documentation we use\nstorybook-design-token. Mainly for its\nDesignTokenDocBlock component, which helps rendering the pages we'll create to display our\n**Design Token** set. **JSON Schema** addon\nWe use our own\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema to display our component structure / API in a Canvas tab, alongside the component.\nRead more about it on our dedicated integration page.\n**Component Token** addon\nFor this we use another Canvas and tab based addon we've written ourselves, to visualize your Component Token:\n@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-token. Especially helps discovering the token layering applied to a component.\nRead more about it on our dedicated integration page.\n## Result\nWith that, we've successfully added\n**Storybook** to our Design System, integrated it with our **Design Token** / **Style Dictionary**, adopted some concepts of **kickstartDS**, and even added a bit of theming! We have our main setup running now, including **Storybook**.\n## Next Step\nIt's time to get to the exciting part... adding components to our Design System. To learn about the different ways you can go about in that, follow our next section!\n## Code Sandbox\nSee the result of this step in the\n**Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step.

If you're struggling somewhere, just look up the section concerned with that part of the setup!\nAnd if following such a long guide (it's quite comprehensive) seems daunting, we also have a starter you can use to have something running in no time (okay, okay... it\nwill take you 5 minutes, but not more!). You can always come back to specific sections here then! The starter also includes exactly the same components that are created in this guide, it just adds more features and configuration to your Design System.\nJust keep this page in mind as a great overview and intro point into\nkickstartDS in general!\nThe main steps involved go as follows:\n- Start your\nDesign System\n- Design Application\n- Configure\nStorybook\n- Add Components\n- Publish your\nDesign System\nThe resulting Design System will obviously not be finished by the end of this guide, but you'll have everything set up to start on the real work.

This also includes some we've written ourselves, to really get the most out of kickstartDS. We'll also add those, and add integration with kickstartDS (tokens, icons, etc).

Read the what, the why and for whom it might be the best path to kickstarting a design system.\nBut first, what is a design system?\nTo provide some shared framing, what we refer to when speaking about design systems is a library of coded components which itself is usually part of a broader platform of shared principles, processes, tools and assets, typically the brand portal of a company. The design system serves as the single point of truth and empowers digital teams to create seamless, brand-consistent and unified experiences. Here is\nNN/g: Nielsen Norman Group‚Äôs description:\nDesign Systems ‚Äì also known as ‚Äúpattern libraries‚Äù or ‚Äúcomponent libraries‚Äù ‚Äì promote quality, consistent UX design across products; and expedite the work of designers, developers, and anyone else working on a digital service.\nIt‚Äôs important to realize that every design system should be the result of different stakeholders within an organization, often sharing the same objectives, but each with their very own perspective.\nThe main user group is normally a multi-disciplinary team of designers, front-end developers and UX. They are the ones primarily caring for, maintaining and sharing the design system. But without the collaboration and contribution of mostly all parties involved in digital product and service creation, such a system will fail tremendously fast. We believe that\nevery organization even running only a few digital experiences will already benefit from a design system. So, when should you ‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶consider initializing a design system?\nOur research showed, that most companies considering to launch a design system, want to (re-)launch a major digital touch point, like their main website or an important new product or service. The larger the organization the more ineffective work without a design system becomes. Often these companies are driven by the following indicators in regards to productivity, quality, accessibility and performance:\n- Why do we or our agency need to invest money into re-creating the same UI design again and again?\n- Why does no one want to re-use existing assets?\n- Why aren‚Äôt they working with the new infrastructure?\n- Can we improve speed-to-market with the new system?\n- Why is every little update taking so much time and resources?\n- Why do so many customers complain about inconsistencies?\n- Why can‚Äôt we change the logo/colors and re-use it for our other brands?\n- Why do we need to refactor everything to match accessibility needs?\nI bet you have your own questions, some of which probably match the ones above.\nChoosing the right starting point\nThe scope of starting a\ndesign system can easily feel overwhelming, and it is tough to know, and feel confident, when and where to start. This is where can be there for you, to support you and your team. Let me introduce our process and how we, in collaborating with you, would tackle that task. We call this a ‚Äúdesign system initiative‚Äù. This is a proven approach with a series of one-to-two-hour workshops, in which we work our way through the thick jungle of topics and questions with you.\nGetting the design system initiative started\nDuring the initiative we usually run around seven to nine workshops including stakeholder mapping, exploring your current inventory as the baseline to synthesize to what should be real core components, in parallel we will sound out a strategy for the technical implementation and ultimately, we will identify a product serving as the potential pilot project. We will adapt the phases and workshops to your individual needs. Therefore the initiative will start with a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù kickoff workshop with your core team, or the people who currently own that responsibility. No need for C-level yet. During that first workshop we introduce our process and guide you through all the steps in more detail. On the one hand, that is for you to get familiar with us, and on the other hand of course for us to get to know\nyou better. We want to learn how you want to communicate with us and the stakeholders, and what your expectation towards the initiative is.\nTalking of stakeholders ‚Ä¶\nA design system is not only a product serving other products, but in the best case also also a medium facilitating communication throughout the whole organization. You need buy-in from all important stakeholders, otherwise this or any other initiative initializing a design system will not succeed. Creating awareness of the shared goals and suitable ways to get the stakeholders involved is helpful to make progress and push things forward. You want the organization to adopt and grow the design system already at an early-stage.\nThat is why we investigate this very early in the process. In the stakeholder workshop we gain a common understanding on why we need to single out and involve specific stakeholders. Next we collect lean persona like cards of the stakeholders. Which we map towards their involvement in a design system overall in the following step. From finding personas who need to take part in decisions to people who just need to be informed on a regular cadence. We also want to identify the stakeholders who need to participate in the next workshops.\nGetting your hands dirty\nThe series of workshops is continued by digging through all the components being used by all digital products the client has. We completely explore your frontend landscape, to inventory and cluster all existing components. Sometimes this step was already performed by internal designers or developers, and possibly led to asking the kickstartDS team for their support. However, this collection and overview will help you to understand what you have, what you might need and make it more likely that everyone, including the important stakeholders, will see the inconsistencies at a single glance. At the end of this workshop all the items will be analyzed and reviewed to decide on relevant elements.\nSplit it up! Identification and technology\nAfter washing our hands, having just dug up all that inconsistent and dusty stuff, we usually start two separate streams: the process of identifying future design system components, while also discussing options for the technical implementation with the IT and operations teams.\nThe identification process will be prepared by us upfront, as an input for the next workshop. Starting from the inventory we will synthesize and unify components, to be specified through tokens and component properties‚Ä¶ to later match the needed layout recipes.\nIn parallel we will work on the implementation strategy. Discussing which tech stack fits best, or what might be the preferred tool chain and build pipeline setup. How future components can be integrated, which process and / or policy needs to be adopted, etc. As you might guess, this is very unique within each organization.\nComing back together\nAlthough components might be developed in isolation, we prefer to again collaborate with you after we turned our focus away for the identification and systematical preparation of future design system components. Meeting again we will share and iterate on our proposal how to structure each element. This will help you to better understand the underlying principles and the architecture for the core of your design system. Which is super important! We might, for example, discuss how to name elements and their options, to shape your design systems‚Äô shared vocabulary.\nFinding the right pilot\nAlthough the launch of your most preciously held project (like your main website, as mentioned in the beginning) may have been one, or even the main, reason you wanted to make use of a design systems‚Äô benefits, we all know that this is not the best first case, due of a multitude of reasons. Nevertheless, together with you we want to solve a real problem. The design system will neither solely succeed due to its comprehensiveness, nor its technical depth in implementation. Together we find a use case where we can solve an existing problem without touching business-critical systems. This will foster engagement with the design system at an early stage and you might already be able to identify potential future advocates. A successful start also raises interest, but also questions and sometimes fears. Good thing is: it fosters communication. Which means that more and more people will be getting involved.\nThe kickstartDS check\nOftentimes a significant part of the identified components are already contained in our kickstartDS starter kit. Especially when the pilot project is content driven and no data rich power user interface. With everything learnt, we will check if kickstartDS would be a solid solution for you to kickstart your own design system. I will promise you, that we will be trustful and honest, and we‚Äôll not just try to sell ourselves as the one and only solution‚Ä¶ even if it might not fit at all. If kickstartDS does not match your needs, we will recommend other solutions, or we can advise you further how to individually implement the components. But as everything done up to this point was completely independent of one specific way of implementing it, it will provide you with the right ammunition to tackle this challenge either way!\nSorry‚Ä¶ that got deeper than I thought. So let me sum up:\nThe\nDesign System Initiative helps you and your team to evaluate the key stakeholders and the necessary inventory, while ultimately, jointly, identifying a design system pilot.\nPlease let me know what experiences you made when considering and initializing a design system from scratch. Or even after the first or second attempt failed.
