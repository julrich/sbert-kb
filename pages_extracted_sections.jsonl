Language not only has the power to build bridges and increase understanding, but also the capability to alienate and dismiss.\nAt Atlassian, our diverse teams build tools for an equally diverse audience, and we strive to use inclusive language in all we do. We know that, as a society, we are always evolving and the language we use must also evolve. This influences how we build things and how we communicate — both internally and externally. We encourage ourselves to seek first to understand the impact of our words, intentional or unintentional, and we diligently reexamine our word choices as we all learn and grow.\nInclusive language is language that is free from words, phrases, or tones that reflect prejudiced, stereotyped, or discriminatory views of particular people or groups. Even when a remark or action based on a stereotype is not based on a conscious prejudice, it can still be hurtful and cause harm or damage to the person on the receiving end.\nWhen we think about inclusivity, we champion “people-first language”. This means that we keep the individual as the most important part of the sentiment and don’t concentrate on characteristics like gender, sexual orientation, religion, racial group, or ability unless it's relevant to the discussion.\nSome of this is new or can be confusing, so\n if you aren’t sure, ask. Strive to include language that reflects peoples’ choice and style in how they talk about themselves.\nThis is a checklist/set of questions and then examples.\nIn using inclusive language, it is useful to keep the following generic questions in mind:\nDo you need to refer to personal characteristics such as sex, religion, racial group, disability, or age at all?\nAre the references to group characteristics couched in inclusive terms?\nDo the references to people reflect the diversity of that audience?\nIs your use of jargon and acronyms (J&A’s) excluding people who may not have specialized knowledge of a particular subject?\nInclusive language does not mean cumbersome, dull, or vague language; it simply means language that has been carefully constructed in ways that treat all people with respect and impartiality.\nWe are a diverse company with individuals from all over the world, delivering software for teams all over the world.

Placing limitations or expectations on people because they belong to a certain group is damaging, hurtful, and discriminatory.\nAvoid phrases that disparage or trivialize the diversity of LGBTIQ people.\nDon't\n“wife/husband” or “girlfriend/boyfriend”\nDo\n“spouse” or “partner”\nReasoning: Reinforces the assumption that all relationships are heterosexual, and renders same-sex relationships invisible.\nDon't\n“fag”, “dyke”, “queer”, “poofta” and “tranny”\nDo\n“gay”, “lesbian”, “bisexual” and “transgender”\nReasoning: These terms are derogatory when used by people outside the LGBTIQ community.\nDon't\n\"gay\" as a negative characteristic\nDo\nWhy be negative in the first place?\nReasoning: It’s homophobic.\nAgeist language relies on stereotyping individuals based on the perceived characteristics of a group. It de-emphasizes the individual - there is more to each of us than our descriptors.\nInclusive language should be sensitive to the entire age range. Terms such as ‘older’ and ‘younger’ are relative and should be used with clarity and in context.\nUse more neutral terms that aren’t definitive such as “older people”, “youth” or “young people”.\nAvoid terms that limit and categorize. Instead, choose terms such as older adults, aging population, or mention the person's relative age or relationship to the other people instead.\nAvoid any stereotyping or connotation that a particular age group is more or less able, or has stereotypical characteristics by virtue of chronological age alone. Avoid using expressions such as ‘a young and vibrant'.\nDon't\nSeniors, elderly, old-folks, senior citizens\nDo\nOlder adults, older person, aging adult\nReasoning: Terms have connotations.\nDon't\n“80-years young”\nDo\nExplicitly say the age – unless this is something they are uncomfortable with\nReasoning: Implies that being young is preferable.\nDon't\n“Young and vibrant”\nDo\n\"Energetic, lively\"\nReasoning: Implies that being young is preferable.\nPeople can make negative and positive assumptions based on where someone lives and their perceived economic status. These assumptions can in turn lead to harmful language based on cultural stereotypes and historic events. Many slang words and idioms can also reference socio-economic status. Remember your own privilege and move away from using classist language.\nInclusive language related to socio-economic status should:\nTreat all people fairly, regardless of where they’re from or what they do\nAvoid negative terms based on where someone’s from or what they do\nOnly be mentioned (without judgment) when relevant to a discussion\nDon't\nBogan or redneck\nDo\nJust don’t!\nReasoning: A negative term relating to someone’s perceived socio-economic status.\nDon't\nHobo\nDo\n\"Person experiencing poverty\"\nReasoning: Makes the experience of homelessness feel like the fault of the person, and defines that person by that single experience.\nDon't\n\"Sold down the river\"\nDo\n\"Thrown under the bus\"\nReasoning: American slavery reference.\nDon't\n“Peanut gallery”\nDo\n\"the crowd\" or \"hecklers\" or \"naysayers\"\nReasoning: A nickname for the cheapest and ostensibly rowdiest seats in the theater, the occupants of which were often known to heckle the performers.

{"url": "https://atlassian.design/content/writing-guidelines/writing-a-success-message", "content": {"raw": "A success message appears after someone has taken an action or completed a task. The message is an opportunity to confirm the action or congratulate them.\nWhen crafting a success message, remember that most people scan text instead of reading everything. Make every word count and avoid irrelevant details.\nTitles are optional depending on the component you choose. Avoid using ‘Success!’ ‘successfully’ in a title.\nInclude an informative, scannable title. Try and imagine people trying to understand what’s happening by reading the title on its own.\nLimit titles to three to four words where possible, excluding “an”, “a”, or “the”. The character count will depend on the component you choose.\nWrite in sentence case and no use of periods.\nAvoid using exclamations! We don't want to be overly enthusiastic about everything!\nInclude the reason for the success — confirm what action someone has taken or what task has been completed. If someone has created something give them an opportunity to view it.\nAvoid repeating content from the title.\nKeep messages to 1 to 2 sentences. Use a few words of praise followed by one or two sentences of informative insight.\nAvoid putting technical information in the message or having people look in another location. If it can't be avoided, use a “Learn more” link.\nIt’s important to show possibility once someone has achieved something. We want to tell people the result of something, for example ‘you’ve closed the ticket'; how to undo it, for example, ‘ask your space admin to restore the page, if needed’; and the step forward if possible, for example ‘View your new space or set the permissions on your new space’.\nCTAs are often optional unless there are any follow-up options. Don’t include a CTA unnecessarily.\nAlways give people an option to dismiss the message.\nWhen a success message invokes a choice, use imperative verbs such as “Save”, “Remove” or “Create”, in the CTA to describe what action people will be making instead of vague terms such as “OK”.\nLimit your CTA to 1 or 2 words.\nSuccess messages should leave people feeling empowered, motivated, and satisfied with their efforts.\nYou want to confirm the outcome and then get out of people’s way. Follow some of the following Atlassian Voice and Tone principles to build your message:\nDelight with unexpectedly pleasing experiences \nWe’re celebrating success or progress once we’ve built trust.

This change doesn’t break existing behavior and can be confined to minimize impact across the design system. Major enhancements, such as adding a new feature to a component, or altering the timeout on a Flag requires system-wide coordination. This impact can be seen across code, design, and guidelines.

Date and time formatters are used to convert dates and times from their internal representations to textual form and back again in a language-independent manner.\nTime and date strings should never be localized manually by a translator as time and date strings should be tied to a user’s locale (country and language) not their language. Hardcoding time and date content is bad practice and creates a bad international customer experience.\nUse abbreviations when space is limited. Be clear about which months or days you are referring to.\nUse these abbreviations for the days of the week:\nMonday – Mon\nTuesday – Tue\nWednesday – Wed\nThursday – Thu\nFriday – Fri\nSaturday – Sat\nSunday – Sun\nUse these abbreviations for the months:\nJanuary – Jan\nFebruary – Feb\nMarch – Mar\nApril – Apr\nMay – leave it as May\nJune – Jun\nJuly – Jul\nAugust – Aug\nSeptember – Sep\nOctober – Oct\nNovember – Nov\nDecember – Dec\nDo\nBe consistent when using abbreviations\nDon't\nDon’t use the shortest form of days and months – F, M, N, etc. If there isn’t room to designate the month, work on redesigning.\nUsually, the month comes before the day, then followed by the year. On the 8th day of the month of January, in the year 2020, then the date in American English can be written as:\nJan 8\nJanuary 8\nJanuary 8, 2020\nMonday, January 8, 2020\nAtlassian uses American English when writing in English. The formats above are broken down below to help when writing absolute values are required. Choose patterns that are appropriate for your context.\nUse full date in cards, bylines, and anywhere else space or your design allows for it:\nUse numerals for the day\nSpell out the month and day of the week in words\nGive the full four-digit year, not a two-digit abbreviation\nDon’t use ordinal numbers, for example, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\nDo\nTuesday, April 12, 1952\nDon't\nTuesday 12th April 1952\nYou can also use a shorter format. Here spell out the month and use numerals for the day and year:\nDo\nApril 12, 1952\nWhen space is limited shorten dates further, for example in lists, tables, charts, and comments.\nSpell out the month using abbreviations\nUse numerals for the day and the year\nWe recommend using the following pattern in most product copy if your context allows for it\nDo\nSep 14, 2006\nWhen you need to leave out either the day or year, where possible, spell out the month in full.\nOctober 22 or July 2019\nWriting dates entirely in numbers has disadvantages when it comes to readability and usability. This is because parts of the world use the date in a different order for numeric dates. Avoid doing this if it's possible because it often also has large UX implications. Instead, we recommend using any of the other date formats above.\nIf it’s absolutely necessary to express a date in numerical date format, use the format YYYY-MM-DD, and separate the elements by using hyphens. This conforms to ISO 8601 international standards for numerical date format.\n2021-05-23\nIn a content draft or design spec if you’re adding a fictional date, choose a day greater than 12. This will help to clearly differentiate the day from the month.\nPunctuation is a localization issue and should be localized wherever possible. Avoid if possible, defaulting to no punctuation.\nWhen writing as numerals separate the numbers with an unspaced hyphen, using the format above.\nAvoid using apostrophes. In more casual writing, you can use expressions such as ‘the seventies’ or 'the '70s' - using contractions for the missing numerals in the year.\nMonths and days are proper nouns and start with a capital letter. Specific days, times of the year or periods in history are all proper nouns. Use capitals for all proper nouns.\nUse initial capitals for all institutional holidays, religious days, and public events:\nNew Year’s Day\nGood Friday\nRamadan\nYom Kippur\nUse ‘to’ if a number range is preceded by ‘from’ in a phrase. Use ‘and’ if a range is preceded by ‘between’. Avoid using hyphens and en dashes in spans of dates.\nDo\nFrom 2015 to 2019\nDon't\n2014 - 2015\nWhen this isn't possible, for example:\nfinancial years\nor when information is in parentheses, such as terms of office and years of birth and death.\nFor these, use a hyphen without any spaces on either side:\nFY2008-09\nJohn Smith (1917–1992) had 3 younger siblings.\nSpring in the northern hemisphere is autumn (fall) in the southern hemisphere. Avoid talking about seasons. Instead, use months or quarters.\nIn most cases, especially when you need to be precise, use numbers to give a clearer expression of time. Use a colon between the hours and minutes with no spaces on either side.\nDo\n3:30:42 p.m. PST\nIf it’s an exact hour, no “:00″ is required. For timestamps, labels on graphs, durations, and more avoid using zeros. Only show minutes if it’s not on the hour.\nDo\n8 a.m.\nDon't\n8:00am\nAs with American English in most cases, we use rules set by the AP style guide.\nLowercase a.m. and p.m., with periods.\nUse numerals, with a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m., for example, 6:30 a.m.\nIf a time range is entirely in the morning or evening, use a.m. or p.m. only once: “6:30-10 p.m.” If it goes from the morning into the evening (or vice versa), you need both: “10 a.m.-2 p.m.”\nWhere possible use ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ instead of ‘12 a.m.’ or ‘12 p.m.’ to make it easier for people.\nUse the 24-hour system if it helps people understand your content. But it’s important to understand that many times this is system-driven. This is important if you’re referring to time in the context of more serious communications, for example, in case of outages and in security comms.\nThe 24-hour system numbers hours from 00:00 hours (midnight) to 23:59 and always uses at least 4 digits. If seconds are included use 6 digits.\nThe first 2 digits are the hours\nThe next 2 digits are the minutes\nThe last 2 digits are the seconds\nUse a colon to separate the hours, minutes, and seconds.\nAvoid using the prefix ‘bi’ to mean either 2 or twice. It can be confusing.\n‘Bimonthly’ can mean either every 2 months or twice a month.\n‘Biannual’ means twice a year.\nInstead, use fortnightly or the phrase ‘every 2’.\nDo\nYour x will repeat every 2 weeks\nDon't\nYour x will repeat bi-monthly\nThis is used when displaying both the date and the time of day. For example, in historical versions of pages. To do this use the following formats\nMMM dd, yyyy HH:mm\ndd, HH:mm\nIt’s important that you express date and time information as you would speak in conversation when the situation allows for it.\nIn some cases, the easiest way to describe something that happened very recently is using the ‘ago’ format. Use this when the exact date is less important. For future and past events, use approximate time by rounding down to the largest or most recent date or time.\nYou should always provide a way for people to see the actual timestamp, usually via a tooltip.\n|Description||Display||Display when limited space|\n|Within the last few seconds||just now||now|\n|Within the last minute||a minute ago||1 m|\n|Within 59 minutes||x minutes ago||X m|\n|60 minutes ago||1 hour ago||1 h|\n|x hours ago||x hours ago||X h|\n|1 day ago||yesterday||1 d|\n|1 day ago (with time)||yesterday at 5:05 pm||n/a|\n|2 days ago < 7 days||x days ago||Use the truncated date (Aug 8)|\n|7 days ago||1 week ago||Use the truncated date (Aug 8)|\n|> 7 days ago||Date stamp: \"August 8, 2018\"||Use the truncated date (Aug 8)|\n|Description||Display||Display when limited space|\n|Within the next few seconds||shortly||now|\n|In the next minute||In 1 minute||in 1 m|\n|In the next 60 minutes||In x minutes||in X m|\n|In 60 minutes||In 1 hour||in 1 hr|\n|In x hours||In x hours||in X hr|\n|In 1 day (by date, not hours)||tomorrow||Use the truncated date (Aug 8)|\n|In 2 to 7 days||In x days|\n|In 7 days||In 1 week|\n|In > 7 days||Date stamp: \"August 8, 2018\"|\n|> 7 days ago||Date stamp: \"August 8, 2018\"|\nDate and time formatting differs greatly from country to country, and even within regions of a country, such as Canada and Switzerland.\nThe Product Internationalization team is responsible for creating product UI content in non-English languages by localizing externalized code strings provided by our Product Engineers.\nIn order to accurately localize date and time formatting for different locales (country and language), we require Engineers to ensure that all content containing the date and time references are not hardcoded and reference built-in i18n libraries/APIs for automatic format\nThe best practice for Internationalization is for Engineers not to hardcode time and date strings and to reference the programming i18n library API which will automatically format time and date strings as per the detected or selected locale.\nWas this page helpful?\nWe use this feedback to improve our documentation.", "markdown": "When you’re working with engineers, all they need is the time and date format length, and the i18n library API will format the date accordingly based on the locale signals Atlassian provides.\nEach programming language has an i18n library that automatically localizes time and date strings based on a user’s locale settings/preferences.

{"url": "https://atlassian.design/patterns/forms", "content": {"raw": "Forms are used to get information and guide people with minimal fuss. Designing forms well requires making decisions about structure, sequence, interface elements, field labels, help, and feedback.\nLabels:Standard label alignment is left-aligned with the field underneath. For the placeholder text, use sentence case and left-align. Required field label:Mark required fields with an asterisk (). If all fields in the form are mandatory, this isn't necessary. Disabled fields:Show disabled fields if users need to know what controls might be available to them. Field length:The length of the field should reflect the intended length of content. Available lengths are 75px, 150px, 250px, 350px, and 500px.\nAutofocus the first field by default. This allows users to tab through elements in the form in a logical way.\nNever disable a submit button, even if all of the required fields aren't filled in. Instead, describe what needs to be done using validation and error messages.\nCommon form components include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, date pickers, toggles, and buttons.\nTitle:Describes the form. If the form is the main item on a page, use an h2 tag, otherwise use h3 and adjust the rest of the page hierarchy accordingly. Follow the title with a short description. Group headline:Describes a group of controls and fields within a form. These should be grouped to help users understand what is required of them in a logical way. Try to make the headline concise and informative, but, if you need to, you can add a short paragraph of text to explain the group. Buttons:Use a primary button for the main action, and a link button to cancel. The primary button should be left-aligned along with the left side of the form field. If additional actions are required, put the primary button first, then any standard buttons, then the link button. The only exception is a multi-step form where the 'Back' standard button sits at the very left, while the rest of the buttons are aligned to the left.\nButtons are sorted by importance from right to left, with the most important button (primary) on the right.\nExceptions to this are single-page forms, flags, cards and section messages where buttons are left aligned; with the primary button on the left.\nWhen users access a form, it can be daunting to be shown a large number of fields that need to be filled out. The threshold for when a form is considered\ntoo long depends on the audience and the context. There are various techniques for lessening the impact of long forms.\nMake sure people know their status at each step of a form.

To accomplish this, we adhere to the guidelines below.\nDownload our logos from the logo library.\nThe Atlassian logo is available in three color schemes: blue, neutral, and white. The blue version works best on a white or light background. The white version should be used on dark backgrounds. The neutral version can be used when the hierarchy calls for the logo to recede, but should always be evaluated for adequate contrast.\nEach of our product logos are also available in three color schemes: blue, neutral, and white. The blue version works best on a white or light background. The white version should be used on dark backgrounds. The neutral version can be used when the hierarchy calls for the logo to recede, but should always be evaluated for adequate contrast.\nTo ensure that logos are clearly visible, surround them with clear space that is free of type, graphics, and other elements that might cause visual clutter.\nUse the capital \"A\" of the Atlassian wordmark to define the minimum clearance around the logo.\nUse the x-height of the logo wordmark to determine minimum clearance around the logo.\nWhen using full logos in a horizontal row, bottom-align to the baseline of the text in the logotype. In a stacked vertical column, left-align the left-most ascenders in the logotype.\nIn a horizontal row, center align logo symbols.\nTo maintain the integrity of the Atlassian logo and to promote the consistency of the brand, please do not misuse it. Some logo crimes are listed below.\nDon't\nUse unapproved color combinations.\nDon't\nUse a drop shadow.\nDon't\nUse the logo on top of complex backgrounds.\nDon't\nCrop the logo.\nDon't\nOutline the logo.\nDon't\nDisproportionately scale the logo.\nThe way we talk about our products will continually grow in complexity (deployments, plans, etc.), so we want to ensure that the credibility and simplicity of the products’ logos are consistent across every use case, now and in future. Contained product logo icons offer more flexibility than full logos because they are removed from the wordmark and allow accompanying information to live alongside the logomark in a way that keeps the information visually separate from the logo.\nContained logomarks should be used in the follow scenarios:\nwhen additional information must be appended to or live closely alongside the logo\nwhen many logos are used together in a grid\nwhen logos live within an environment where rendering the product name natively in its environment is more legible and user friendly (such as a product UI component)\nwhen environmental restrictions do not allow for proper clearance guidelines to be followed for full logos\nwhen logos live within an external environment that mandates a container (such as external marketplaces, mobile app icons, and so on)\nContained logomarks are available in three colors:\nblue on N20 background (standard)\nneutral on N20 background\nwhite on B400 background\nHow to choose color\nOur standard color is\nblue on N20 background, which is reflected across most Atlassian-owned properties. However, these colors do not hold any semantic meaning across Atlassian properties. The color used should be determined by the environment the logos live in and the intent that the designer has for them.\nContained logomarks are intentionally available in a square format with no corner radius so that they can be adapted to any environment’s requirements. The size of the contained logomark is flexible but it's critical that the mark and the container are scaled proportionally to one another.\nHow to choose shape and size\nOur standard shape and size is 80×80px with 3px corner radius across most Atlassian-owned properties. However, shape and size should be determined by the environment the logos live in. For instance, Apple mobile apps will require a different corner radius than the Google Marketplace.\nGenerally, you may use one third of the width or height of the contained mark to determine the appropriate amount of space around the container. Information can be aligned to any edge of the container.\nInformation may be middle aligned with the icon when the copy does not exceed the height of the container. When the information is longer than the height of the container, it may be top-aligned or stacked below and center-aligned.\nA lockup is a combination of multiple logo components or a logo combined with text in order to signify a relationship or create additional context. Lockups should be used as a single asset and abide by all standard logo rules.\nAttribution lockups allow us to unify our product brands with the Atlassian wordmark and ensure that customers connect the dots between Atlassian and our land products (Confluence, Compass, Trello, Jira, and all Jira family products). Only use existing attribution lockups provided here and do not deconstruct them or create new ones.\nAttribution lockups should be used for when Atlassian context is not readily set by the environment, like on advertisements or other top of funnel touch points like videos and white papers. Attribution lockups are\nnot necessary on Atlassian-owned properties like www.atlassian.com or in the product user interface.\nUse the Atlassian product strapline when you need to include multiple product names (specifically, Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket) with the Atlassian logo. Always use centered versions of the product names under the logo, but do not alter it in any way. For best results, the logo strapline should never be scaled below 280px wide.\nAtlassian programs and properties use a logo and a Charlie Sans lockup.

Always use centered versions of the product names under the logo, but do not alter it in any way. For best results, the logo strapline should never be scaled below 280px wide. Atlassian programs and properties use a logo and a Charlie Sans lockup. On a white background, the program name is rendered in neutral (N800) with the logo in primary blue (B400). On darker backgrounds, both program and logo are white. Was this page helpful? We use this feedback to improve our documentation.", "tokens": 463}]}

{"url": "https://atlassian.design/content/writing-guidelines/writing-guidelines/date-and-time-guideline", "content": {"raw": "A note for Content Designers\nWhen you’re working with engineers, all they need is the time and date format length, and the i18n library API will format the date accordingly based on the locale signals Atlassian provides.\nEach programming language has an i18n library that automatically localizes time and date strings based on a user’s locale settings/preferences. Date and time formatters are used to convert dates and times from their internal representations to textual form and back again in a language-independent manner.\nTime and date strings should never be localized manually by a translator as time and date strings should be tied to a user’s locale (country and language) not their language. Hardcoding time and date content is bad practice and creates a bad international customer experience.\nAbbreviating days and months\nUse abbreviations when space is limited. Be clear about which months or days you are referring to.\nUse these abbreviations for the days of the week:\nMonday – Mon\nTuesday – Tue\nWednesday – Wed\nThursday – Thu\nFriday – Fri\nSaturday – Sat\nSunday – Sun\nUse these abbreviations for the months:\nJanuary – Jan\nFebruary – Feb\nMarch – Mar\nApril – Apr\nMay – leave it as May\nJune – Jun\nJuly – Jul\nAugust – Aug\nSeptember – Sep\nOctober – Oct\nNovember – Nov\nDecember – Dec\nDo\nBe consistent when using abbreviations\nDon't\nDon’t use the shortest form of days and months – F, M, N, etc. If there isn’t room to designate the month, work on redesigning.\nThe date format in American English\nUsually, the month comes before the day, then followed by the year. On the 8th day of the month of January, in the year 2020, then the date in American English can be written as:\nJan 8\nJanuary 8\nJanuary 8, 2020\nMonday, January 8, 2020\nAtlassian uses American English when writing in English. The formats above are broken down below to help when writing absolute values are required. Choose patterns that are appropriate for your context.\nLong date\nUse full date in cards, bylines, and anywhere else space or your design allows for it:\nUse numerals for the day\nSpell out the month and day of the week in words\nGive the full four-digit year, not a two-digit abbreviation\nDon’t use ordinal numbers, for example, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\nDo\nTuesday, April 12, 1952\nDon't\nTuesday 12th April 1952\nMedium date\nYou can also use a shorter format. Here spell out the month and use numerals for the day and year:\nDo\nApril 12, 1952\nShort date\nWhen space is limited shorten dates further, for example in lists, tables, charts, and comments.\nSpell out the month using abbreviations\nUse numerals for the day and the year\nWe recommend using the following pattern in most product copy if your context allows for it\nDo\nSep 14, 2006\nWhen you need to leave out either the day or year, where possible, spell out the month in full.\nOctober 22 or July 2019\nNumerical dates\nWriting dates entirely in numbers has disadvantages when it comes to readability and usability. This is because parts of the world use the date in a different order for numeric dates. Avoid doing this if it's possible because it often also has large UX implications. Instead, we recommend using any of the other date formats above.\nIf it’s absolutely necessary to express a date in numerical date format, use the format YYYY-MM-DD, and separate the elements by using hyphens. This conforms to ISO 8601 international standards for numerical date format.\n2021-05-23\nIn a content draft or design spec if you’re adding a fictional date, choose a day greater than 12. This will help to clearly differentiate the day from the month.\nGrammar and punctuation\nPunctuation is a localization issue and should be localized wherever possible. Avoid if possible, defaulting to no punctuation.\nHyphens\nWhen writing as numerals separate the numbers with an unspaced hyphen, using the format above.\nApostrophes\nAvoid using apostrophes. In more casual writing, you can use expressions such as ‘the seventies’ or 'the '70s' - using contractions for the missing numerals in the year.\nCapital and lower case\nMonths and days are proper nouns and start with a capital letter. Specific days, times of the year or periods in history are all proper nouns. Use capitals for all proper nouns.\nUse initial capitals for all institutional holidays, religious days, and public events:\nNew Year’s Day\nGood Friday\nRamadan\nYom Kippur\nUsing ‘to’ and ‘from’\nUse ‘to’ if a number range is preceded by ‘from’ in a phrase. Use ‘and’ if a range is preceded by ‘between’. Avoid using hyphens and en dashes in spans of dates.\nDo\nFrom 2015 to 2019\nDon't\n2014 - 2015\nWhen this isn't possible, for example:\nfinancial years\nor when information is in parentheses, such as terms of office and years of birth and death.\nFor these, use a hyphen without any spaces on either side:\nFY2008-09\nJohn Smith (1917–1992) had 3 younger siblings.\nDivisions of the year\nSpring in the northern hemisphere is autumn (fall) in the southern hemisphere. Avoid talking about seasons. Instead, use months or quarters.\nTime\nIn most cases, especially when you need to be precise, use numbers to give a clearer expression of time. Use a colon between the hours and minutes with no spaces on either side.\nDo\n3:30:42 p.m. PST\nIf it’s an exact hour, no “:00″ is required. For timestamps, labels on graphs, durations, and more avoid using zeros. Only show minutes if it’s not on the hour.\nDo\n8 a.m.\nDon't\n8:00am\nUsing ‘a.m.’ and ‘p.m.’\nAs with American English in most cases, we use rules set by the AP style guide.\nLowercase a.m. and p.m., with periods.\nUse numerals, with a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m., for example, 6:30 a.m.\nIf a time range is entirely in the morning or evening, use a.m. or p.m. only once: “6:30-10 p.m.” If it goes from the morning into the evening (or vice versa), you need both: “10 a.m.-2 p.m.”\nNoon, midday, and midnight\nWhere possible use ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ instead of ‘12 a.m.’ or ‘12 p.m.’ to make it easier for people.\nThe 24-hour system\nUse the 24-hour system if it helps people understand your content. But it’s important to understand that many times this is system-driven.

Hardcoding time and date content is bad practice and creates a bad international customer experience.\n## Abbreviating days and months\nUse abbreviations when space is limited. Be clear about which months or days you are referring to.\nUse these abbreviations for the days of the week:\nMonday – Mon\nTuesday – Tue\nWednesday – Wed\nThursday – Thu\nFriday – Fri\nSaturday – Sat\nSunday – Sun\nUse these abbreviations for the months:\nJanuary – Jan\nFebruary – Feb\nMarch – Mar\nApril – Apr\nMay – leave it as May\nJune – Jun\nJuly – Jul\nAugust – Aug\nSeptember – Sep\nOctober – Oct\nNovember – Nov\nDecember – Dec\n#### Do\nBe consistent when using abbreviations\n#### Don't\nDon’t use the shortest form of days and months – F, M, N, etc. If there isn’t room to designate the month, work on redesigning.\n## The date format in American English\nUsually, the month comes before the day, then followed by the year. On the 8th day of the month of January, in the year 2020, then the date in American English can be written as:\nJan 8\nJanuary 8\nJanuary 8, 2020\nMonday, January 8, 2020\nAtlassian uses American English when writing in English. The formats above are broken down below to help when writing absolute values are required. Choose patterns that are appropriate for your context.\n### Long date\nUse full date in cards, bylines, and anywhere else space or your design allows for it:\nUse numerals for the day\nSpell out the month and day of the week in words\nGive the full four-digit year, not a two-digit abbreviation\nDon’t use ordinal numbers, for example, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\n#### Do\nTuesday, April 12, 1952\n#### Don't\nTuesday 12th April 1952\n### Medium date\nYou can also use a shorter format. Here spell out the month and use numerals for the day and year:\n#### Do\nApril 12, 1952\n### Short date\nWhen space is limited shorten dates further, for example in lists, tables, charts, and comments.\nSpell out the month using abbreviations\nUse numerals for the day and the year\nWe recommend using the following pattern in most product copy if your context allows for it\n#### Do\nSep 14, 2006\nWhen you need to leave out either the day or year, where possible, spell out the month in full.\nOctober 22 or July 2019\n## Numerical dates\nWriting dates entirely in numbers has disadvantages when it comes to readability and usability. This is because parts of the world use the date in a different order for numeric dates. Avoid doing this if it's possible because it often also has large UX implications. Instead, we recommend using any of the other date formats above.\nIf it’s absolutely necessary to express a date in numerical date format, use the format YYYY-MM-DD, and separate the elements by using hyphens. This conforms to ISO 8601 international standards for numerical date format.\n2021-05-23\nIn a content draft or design spec if you’re adding a fictional date, choose a day greater than 12. This will help to clearly differentiate the day from the month.\n## Grammar and punctuation\nPunctuation is a localization issue and should be localized wherever possible. Avoid if possible, defaulting to no punctuation.\n### Hyphens\nWhen writing as numerals separate the numbers with an unspaced hyphen, using the format above.\n### Apostrophes\nAvoid using apostrophes. In more casual writing, you can use expressions such as ‘the seventies’ or 'the '70s' - using contractions for the missing numerals in the year.\n### Capital and lower case\nMonths and days are proper nouns and start with a capital letter. Specific days, times of the year or periods in history are all proper nouns. Use capitals for all proper nouns.\nUse initial capitals for all institutional holidays, religious days, and public events:\nNew Year’s Day\nGood Friday\nRamadan\nYom Kippur\n## Using ‘to’ and ‘from’\nUse ‘to’ if a number range is preceded by ‘from’ in a phrase. Use ‘and’ if a range is preceded by ‘between’. Avoid using hyphens and en dashes in spans of dates.\n#### Do\nFrom 2015 to 2019\n#### Don't\n2014 - 2015\nWhen this isn't possible, for example:\nfinancial years\nor when information is in parentheses, such as terms of office and years of birth and death.\nFor these, use a hyphen without any spaces on either side:\nFY2008-09\nJohn Smith (1917–1992) had 3 younger siblings.\n## Divisions of the year\nSpring in the northern hemisphere is autumn (fall) in the southern hemisphere. Avoid talking about seasons. Instead, use months or quarters.\n## Time\nIn most cases, especially when you need to be precise, use numbers to give a clearer expression of time. Use a colon between the hours and minutes with no spaces on either side.\n#### Do\n3:30:42 p.m. PST\nIf it’s an exact hour, no “:00″ is required. For timestamps, labels on graphs, durations, and more avoid using zeros. Only show minutes if it’s not on the hour.\n#### Do\n8 a.m.\n#### Don't\n8:00am\n## Using ‘a.m.’ and ‘p.m.’\nAs with American English in most cases, we use rules set by the AP style guide.\nLowercase a.m. and p.m., with periods.\nUse numerals, with a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m., for example, 6:30 a.m.\nIf a time range is entirely in the morning or evening, use a.m. or p.m. only once: “6:30-10 p.m.” If it goes from the morning into the evening (or vice versa), you need both: “10 a.m.-2 p.m.”\n## Noon, midday, and midnight\nWhere possible use ‘noon’, ‘midday’ or ‘midnight’ instead of ‘12 a.m.’ or ‘12 p.m.’ to make it easier for people.\n## The 24-hour system\nUse the 24-hour system if it helps people understand your content. But it’s important to understand that many times this is system-driven. This is important if you’re referring to time in the context of more serious communications, for example, in case of outages and in security comms.\nThe 24-hour system numbers hours from 00:00 hours (midnight) to 23:59 and always uses at least 4 digits.

It was designed to be incredibly versatile with lots of range in terms of tone and playfulness. It can be quirky and expressive when it needs to be, or neutral when the situation calls for something a bit more serious. On rare occasions, we also use native typography for selected elements.\nCharlie is available in two styles, Display and Text.\nWe use native typography for all in-product experiences. This ensures that the UI is optimized to be highly legible, performs well, and is frictionless as you move between Atlassian products and the rest of the system.\nWe use sans serif fonts for most of our type in-product, the exception being when you want to display code then you should defer to monospace fonts.\n|OS||Font family|\n|Windows||Segoe UI|\n|MacOS & iOS||SF Pro Text|\n|SF Pro Display|\n|SF UI Text (deprecated)|\n|SF UI Display (deprecated)|\n|Helvetica Neue (fallback)|\n|Chrome OS & Android||Roboto|\n|Noto Sans (fallback)|\n|Droid Sans (fallback)|\n|Ubuntu||Ubuntu|\n|OxygenOS||Oxygen|\n|Firefox OS||Fira Sans|\nfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\n|OS||Font family|\n|Windows||Segoe UI Mono|\n|Consolas|\n|Courier|\n|MacOS & iOS||SF Mono Medium|\n|SF Mono|\n|Menlo|\n|Chrome OS & Android||Roboto Mono|\n|Ubuntu||Ubuntu Mono|\nfont-family: 'SFMono-Medium', 'SF Mono', 'Segoe UI Mono', 'Roboto Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', Menlo, Consolas, Courier, monospace;\nKeeping typography consistent and sticking to logical hierarchies ensures that elements in the UI are clear and easily recognizable when scanning the page.

Wide lines of text are difficult to read and make it harder for people to focus. While there is no right way to measure the perfect width for text, a good goal is to aim for between 60 and 100 characters per line including spacing. Setting an optimal line length will break up content into easily digestible information.\nReaders may also have control over the layout width, meaning that a line length can not always be specified. So it's good practice to design for an ideal line length range under normal circumstances, and use responsive design techniques to anticipate different contexts.\nWhen displaying content in a fluid layout, set the max-width (680 in the example below). When the viewport is resized and the content has reached the max-width, the container will continue to expand with even margins on either side. When the viewport has been resized and the content is below the max-width, the content will snap to 100% of the container with the specified margins on either side.\nOur service sites use a mixture of both marketing and product typography and is assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on the following considerations:\nAtlassian messaging vs. user-generated or modified content\neditorial content vs. technical content\nbrand marketing visual styles vs. product UI visual styles\nconsistency across sites vs. one-off solutions\nPlease work directly with the Creative & Design teams when assessing typography for these types of properties.\nAtlassian relies on several third-party services to provide content and information to Atlassian employees, partners, and sometimes, users.

It's almost always used to support copy, and should never distract or overshadow the key message. Illustration plays a more prominent role in marketing than in product in order to help tell stories, and is most commonly used in the following places:\nwebsites, landing pages, microsites, service sites\npresentations\ndemand generation assets (banner ads, etc)\nsocial media\ninfographic\nswag\nConsider the following principles for how we want to be perceived through illustrations.\nOur illustration style takes larger-than-life achievements and makes them human and relatable. Being bold means taking on massive goals, feeling empowered, and being confident that those goals are achievable. It's not about being loud, noisy, or over-the-top. It's about setting a goal and acknowledging the inherent complexity in getting things done. We use clean shapes, plenty of white space, and balanced color ratios to ensure that the scene never feels too chaotic.\nOur illustrations feature future-forward narratives that center around teams working together to improve the world around them. The Atlassian illustration style reflects our belief that a team is capable of tackling any task, no matter how big or complex. Stylistically, bright color and a sense of low-gravity lend a lightness and buoyancy to our storytelling, driving home the point that when we work together, anything is achievable.\nThough our illustration style is slightly fantastical, it should never feel impractical or naive. We reinforce the real-life nature of teamwork through perspective and depth. We add in 'wink' through slight tweaks to the dimension of people and things.

This allows them to be more metaphorical and fantastical in nature. The viewer should feel a sense of teamwork, adventure, achievement, and optimism. In the majority of cases, a central, larger-than-life object should be surrounded by a team working to build, fix, and assemble. Hero illustrations contain more than three people and their complexity should vary depending on the intended size.\nSpot heroes are slightly simplified versions of heroes, visually and metaphorically. These assets are perfect when you need to pack a punch with limited space. Often they are a slightly more literal representation of a single concept. Despite simplification, they still contain a small team working on or around a larger-than-life subject.\nSpot illustrations are the simplest and most literal expression of a concept. Because they are often used in the product as an empty state, or in a composition with other spot illustrations, they are small and simple. They usually do not include any people but occasionally include some atmospheric background elements, depending on the design.\nMeeples are a category in and of themselves and are created at both high and low fidelities for optimum flexibility. They can be used on their own, but are often combined with other illustrations.\nFull-size meeples\nWhen you talk about 'Bob', 'a customer', 'my team' or 'me', you need something more immediately relatable than low-fi pieces of a larger concept. For this reason, full-size meeples are more human and are designed to register as actual people versus concepts of people.\nSimplified meeples\nWhen space is tight, or a configuration calls for complexity, use simplified meeples so that individuals and teams can be displayed at a lower fidelity.\nMeeple scenes\nSometimes, we need to depict individuals in environments that tell a story and set context.

Overflow shadows are reserved for experiences where a border might be easily missed, such as in very small UI or tables that use borders to separate cells. Both approaches should apply the appropriate surface token where the content is being hidden. For the full list of elevation design tokens and their values, see our design token reference list. Every token comes with a description to help you ensure you’re using the correct one. Raised and overlay elevations have dedicated surface and shadow pairings.", "tokens": 359}]}

It is about understanding the users' journeys and proactively anticipating their needs.\nTo make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow the four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:\nPerceivable:It can be perceived by at least one of a person's senses. Operable:All interactions are operable through a variation of input methods. Understandable:Information and operation of the interface must be understandable. Robust:Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.\nConsistent and clear hierarchy helps people who navigate the page using links or headers. Use headings and titles to outline the page so people can see the structure and how sections relate to each other.\nBe predictable with structure and use patterns and layouts familiar to people.\nContent should be visible, so avoid putting important information inside accordions.\nPlace items on the page in order of their level of importance so people don't have to search for them.\nCreate and maintain a consistent hierarchy so that people can use alternative input methods to move through the page. Headings are in order without skipping levels.\nDo\nUse a consistent heading hierarchy: H1, H2, H3, H4\nDon't\nUse headings out of order: H2, H1, H3, H3\nTest the UI to ensure the layout works for different languages and assistive technologies. Consider languages that require longer text fields and text wrapping. Also consider how the UI looks at 200% magnification.\nGroup items under titles or headings that clearly communicate the content of the group.\nDo\nGrouped items under title 'Worked on' clearly shows documents that you have worked on.\nDon't\nGrouped items under vague title 'Pages' shows random documents.\nSome people can't use a mouse and navigate through applications using tools such as a keyboard, mouth wand, or eye tracking system. People should be able to navigate and use the product with a keyboard or screen reader. Make sure anything that can be seen by hovering with a mouse is also accessible to keyboard focus and screen readers.\nWhen creating an application, check if a keyboard can be used to:\nnavigate\nperform the same tasks as people who use a mouse\nlocate where you are on the page\ntell where the keyboard focus is\nKeyboard focus follows the page as the eye would scan it. Focus travels top to bottom, left to right, moving from most to least important item. People can navigate applications using alternative input methods (D-pads, trackballs, keyboards, and navigation gestures), and the focus flows in a logical order.\nWhen assessing keyboard focus:\nBe conscious of the order of elements on the page. Do they make sense from the user's perspective?\nIndicate where focus is.\nAvoid using input focus to select, trigger events, or display messages. People may need to navigate through all controls before making changes.\nKeep in mind where the focus moves when the element in focus disappears. People should return to wherever they were before they focused on the element.\nTooltips can be activated by keyboard. When an element gets keyboard focus, a tooltip displays. When that element loses focus, the tooltip disappears.\nValidate forms inline so keyboard users don't have to navigate far to get feedback.\nIdeally, design interactions to prevent errors happening in the first place and help people fix problems as they occur.\nConsistent and helpful text makes the user interface accessible to people who use a screen reader. Screen readers help people with visual impairments by reading both visible and non-visible alternative text aloud.\nAll text should support accessibility, whether it's visible (UI labels, headings, buttons, forms, hyperlinks, and help text) or non-visible (alternative text for images and buttons).\nKeep content and accessibility text concise. People using screen readers hear every UI element read aloud, so the shorter the text, the faster they can navigate the content.\nScreen readers can skim more easily and skip irrelevant paragraphs if you keep sentences short and frontload paragraphs with important information.\nPlain English helps people skim and digest information faster. It also makes content more accessible to those who speak English as a second, third, or fourth language.\nAvoid idioms and always expand acronyms when using them for the first time.\nConsistently label elements and components that have the same functionality. When people encounter these elements in different contexts, they should be able to recognize and understand the function or actions of an element. For instance, a menu item that is labeled\nAll sprints should open a page that is titled All sprints. A dialogue with the title Copy page has a button labeled Copy.\nDo\nTitle Copy page with a button labeled Copy.\nDon't\nTitle Copy page with a button labeled Duplicate.\nLabel elements with action verbs that indicate what happens when the element is selected.\nDo\nEdit preferences - When read aloud, the text indicates the action.\nDon't\nPreferences - Just labeling the element doesn't make it clear what will happen when it is selected.\nIn buttons, describe what the action does and, if you can, reveal what will happen.\nDo\nAdd room\nDon't\nGo for it!\nLink text should indicate where the link navigates to. When linking text we use “Learn more” along with a description of where we are taking the user. Link your entire message. For in-app or in-product links don’t use a period (full stop) at the end of the sentence.\nE.g. Learn more about Jira permissions\nLinking the entire message gives users context about the link destination lowering their cognitive load.\nThese links take a user who is visually impaired through hearing a screen reader repeat “Learn more” at this time while tabbing through a page. Linking the full message also helps navigation using screen readers and allows the text to stand alone.\nAdd skip links or anchors to help people navigate around content pages.\nFor important information, use text rather than images. Only use images that usefully add to the text.\nDescribe non-text elements in the UI or with alternative text so screen readers can succinctly describe images and media.\nAvoid moving or flashing images if possible.\nIf an image contains information that can only be understood by seeing the image, then you need to explain the content of the image using alternative text. Follow these guidelines when you write alt text:\nThe text should be an adequate replacement for both the content and the function of the image.\nDetermine the correct content and then deliver that message as succinctly as possible. Aim for no more than a few words, though sometimes a short sentence or two may be necessary.\nDon't repeat information that is contained in the text found on the page around the image.\nDon't use phrases like \"image of ...\" or \"a photo of ...\" to describe the image. This is apparent when using screen readers and the description itself should be enough to replace the meaning of the image.\nIf the meaning and content of an image is conveyed by surrounding text, header, or captions, then you might not need as much alternative text.\nIf the image is used strictly to make the page pleasant to the eye, doesn't contain a link, and isn't used to deliver information, then include the alt attribute, but leave it empty. For example,\nalt=\"\"\nA complex image could be a diagram, table or chart. Depending on the level of complexity, the image may need text near it explaining the contents, short alt text that complements this and possibly a link to a page with a long text description.\nProvide transcripts and in-sync captioning. Make sure users can control when the video or gif starts and stops.\nProvide audio description for any text displayed in a video.\nWe comply with AA standard contrast ratios. To do this, we choose primary, secondary and extended colors that support usability. This ensures sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use our products.\nDon't convey information using color alone. Use multiple visual cues, such as stroke weight, patterns, shape, text, or illustrations to ensure that everyone receives the same information. This helps people who are unable to, or have difficulty with, distinguishing one color from another. This includes people who are color blind, have low vision, or are blind.\nFor example, these inline validation messages use both color and icons to distinguish severity:\nDo\nThe success message uses a tick icon and is green in color. The error message uses an exclamation point and is red in color.\nDon't\nColor is the only visual cue to distinguish severity. The success message is green in color. The error message is red in color.\nHigh color contrast helps people who are partially or completely color blind see differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improves usability for everyone. Make sure that the combination of text and background color do not fall below the WCAG recommended threshold ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text and 3:1 for larger text.\nDecorative images and disabled states don't have contrast requirements.\nDo\nUse high contrast color combinations that pass AA compliance.\nDon't\nDon't use low contrast color combinations that fail AA compliance.\nThese guidelines will help improve accessibility in your applications, but they don't guarantee a fully accessible experience. We also recommend you:\ntest the entire application and journeys using various assistive technologies and text scaling\ninclude people with impairments when testing\nensure the tasks in your applications can be accomplished by anyone, regardless of ability\nWhen in doubt, refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1.\nWas this page helpful?\nWe use this feedback to improve our documentation.", "markdown": "Products and web properties need to be accessible to everyone, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments.\nAccessible design is everyone's responsibility, from information and user experience design, through to development, and on into help and support.

For more information, see the new colors, new elevations, and design tokens. The colors shown below remain in use today across Atlassian products.\nUse focused, meaningful color to pinpoint exactly what people need to see. We are committed to complying with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast ratios.\nTo do this, choose primary, secondary, and extended colors that support usability by ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use our products.\nOur primary palette is comprised of neutrals, white, and blue to bring boldness to our brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important bits. We pepper warmer, secondary palette colors throughout to soften the experience and to impart confidence and optimism.\nWe use blue (B400) for primary actions, buttons, text links, for indicating progress and representing authentication. Neutral (N800) is used primarily for body text and headings, and white (N0) is used for page backgrounds.\nDownload our color palettes.\nB400 - Pacific bridge\n0052CC\n0, 82, 204\nN800 - Squid ink\n172B4D\n23, 43, 77\nN0 - Doctor\nFFFFFF\n255, 255, 255\nOur secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and interesting. We lean on these colors more frequently when brand awareness is high, or on our own properties where we control the surrounding environment. When used in conjunction with our primary palette, these colors make every moment feel on-brand and every interaction informative.\nOur secondary palette is made up of red (R300), yellow (Y300), green (G300), teal (T300), and purple (P300). Each color is selected intentionally to provide meaningful feedback within our products. See the semantic color guidelines below for more information.\nR300 - Poppy surprise\nFF5630\n255, 86, 48\nY300 - Golden state\nFFAB00\n255, 171, 0\nG300 - Fine pine\n36B37E\n54, 179, 126\nT300 - Tamarama\n00B8D9\n0, 184, 217\nP300 - Da' juice\n6554C0\n101, 84, 192\nThe extended palette consists of all the useable tints and shades of each color in the palette. They are all numbered for easy reference. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for illustrations and components in product.\nNeutrals have varying degrees of saturation that allow for the appropriate level of warmth across marketing and product. Typically they are used for text and subtle backgrounds when we don't want to draw too much attention to a particular touchpoint or convey information such as \"to do\" or \"disabled\".\nDark neutrals\nDark neutrals are very effective for creating contrast and are therefore the primary color used for typography. Occasionally the dark neutrals are found in illustration but they rarely dominate the palette. Some exceptions are dark mode UI elements and illustrations.\nN900 - Slate\n091E42\n9, 30, 66\nN800 - Squid ink\n172B4D\n23, 43, 77\nN700 - Snorlax\n253858\n37, 56, 88\nN600 - Pet rock\n344563\n52, 69, 99\nN500 - McFanning\n42526E\n66, 82, 110\nMid-neutrals\nUse mid-neutrals to create depth in components such as modal dialog blankets and cards. Avoid mid-neutrals as background colors because there is usually not enough contrast to remain AA compliant. The mid-neutrals N400 to N200 can be used for subtle text and icons on light-neutral backgrounds. You can find text style using these colors in Typography.\nN400 - Concrete jungle\n505F79\n80, 95, 121\nN300 - Clooney\n5E6C84\n94, 108, 132\nN200 - Bling bling\n6B778C\n107, 119, 140\nN100 - Humboldt fog\n7A869A\n122, 134, 154\nN90 - Meredith\n8993A4\n137, 147, 164\nN80 - Spooky ghost\n97A0AF\n151, 160, 175\nN70 - Blanche\nA5ADBA\n165, 173, 186\nN60 - Sentinel\nB3BAC5\n179, 186, 197\nLight neutrals\nWe use light neutrals as subtle backgrounds to indicate various interactive states such as hover and disabled, or simply to create secondary attention towards a component. You'll find light neutrals in buttons, text fields, tags, and illustrations.\nLight neutrals are helpful for offsetting content in a primarily white layout without losing warmth and cleanliness and are therefore often used as a background color.

In addition to the color usage guidelines for web, there are also iOS and Android application color guidelines that augment the color guidelines for those platforms.\nWas this page helpful?\nWe use this feedback to improve our documentation.", "markdown": "## A new color system, design tokens, and themes are coming soon\nDesign tokens and theming will soon change how we use color, opacity, and elevations. For more information, see the new colors, new elevations, and design tokens. The colors shown below remain in use today across Atlassian products.\nUse focused, meaningful color to pinpoint exactly what people need to see. We are committed to complying with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast ratios.\nTo do this, choose primary, secondary, and extended colors that support usability by ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use our products.\nOur primary palette is comprised of neutrals, white, and blue to bring boldness to our brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important bits. We pepper warmer, secondary palette colors throughout to soften the experience and to impart confidence and optimism.\nWe use blue (B400) for primary actions, buttons, text links, for indicating progress and representing authentication.
